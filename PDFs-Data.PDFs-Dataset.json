Biyani Securities Pvt. As the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a\ncoincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both\nparties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same\nquantity of shares almost simultaneously.”\nSuch transactions wherein the buy and sell orders were entered almost\nsimultaneously and the time lag is just under few seconds as aforesaid\nand the transactions are matched in terms of order quantity, price and\ntime are highly irregular and defeat the purpose of normal order matching\nsystem in the price discovery process in the exchanges and would also be\nin violation of Regulation of 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair\nTrade Practices relating to Securities Market) 1995 which reads as under:-\nPage 36 of 41Prohibition against market manipulation. Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and\nselling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and\nquantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy\norders.

  "summary": "Therefore this case is covered\nby the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell's\ncase(') ...... \" Applying this line of reasoning the High\nCourt differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and\nallowed the deduction to the respondent company under\nsection 10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act, as claimed by\nthe respondents. Mitter\nor S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Manag-\ning Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to\nreimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to oe\nmade in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter\nappearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS\nAND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED\n(i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by\nthe said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131\nof the Articles of Association of the Company, the\nCompany shall have paramount lien on and deduct\nand set off a moiety thereof against any payment\nwhich the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees\nor any of them and/or costs of the said suits. Nowhere in the statement\nof the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the\nHigh Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion\nthat the payment was made by the assessee company\nto avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself\nfrom scandal or in order to maintain the managing\nagency of the appellant company. When the matter came\nbefore the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case\nfor the present respondents, as shown by the judgment\nof the High Court, urged as follows:-\" If the applicant\n-\ncompany had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned\ni 1l [J 921) 1 R. B. The High Court\nthereafter noticed several cases including 111 itchell' s\ncase(') and towards the close of the judgment delivered\nby Chatterjea J. observed as follows:-\"In this case it\nis clear that the agreement was entered into with a view\nto avoid the publicity of an action against the mana\nging agents and consequent exposure and scandal and\nin order to maintain the managing agency so that the\ncompany could carry on its business as before. \"Ag•ncy the danger of public exposure and in order to save\nLtd. itself from the scandal and in order to maintain the\nmanaging agency, the applicant company agreed to\nKania o. J. deduct certain amounts from the managing agency\ncommission and therefore such expenditure came with\nin section 10(2) (xv) of the Act.\" The jurisdiction of the High Court v.\nin the matter of income-tax references is an advisory\nCalcutta Agency\njurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Ltd.\nTribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully\nassailed on the ground that there was no evidence for Ka1ita C. J,\nthe conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribunal. In the High Court the assessees' counsel\nargued, relying on the case cf Mitchell v. B. W. Noble Ltd.(1),\nthat the payments were made by th• assessees to avoid the\npublicity of an action against them and the consequent exposure\nand loss of reputation as a. managing agency company, and as\nsuch the payments were deductible as business expenditure. v.\nAs the statement of the case prepared by the Appellate Tri· Calcutta Ag•ncy\nbunal in accordance v.'ith the rules fran1ed under the Income-tax Ltd.\nAct is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and\nthey have full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion\nfrom that statement, if they have approved of the state1nent n1ade\nby the Tribunal, it iR the agreed etatement of facts by the parties\non w bich the Iligh Court has to pronouncs its judgment. The whole con-\nclusion of the High Court is based on this unwarranted\nassumption of facts which are taken only from the\nargument of counsel for the present respondents before\n••\n1016 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950)\nthe High Court. that the jurisdiction of the High Court in these matters\nCommm•\n·\notn \"u of·i s on l y a d v1· sory an d t 1 i e cone l usw· ns o f t J i e T n' b u na1\n1\n;,;:;m;~:a~z on facts are the conclusions on which the High Conrt\nis to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated\nv,\nOa'cutta Agency by this case. It is therefore clear that the necessary\nfacts required to be established before the principles\nlaid down in Mitchell's case(2 could be applied, have\n)\nnot been found as facts in the present case at any stage\nof the proceedings and the High Court was in error\nil) 6 I.T.C. 449,•\n1014 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950]\nin the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton\n1950\nMills Ltd. would have sued the company for the reali\nOommi\"'•\"\"' of sation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems\nIncom•·tax, that there would have been no defence to the action. Held, that the High Court acted wrongly in accepting the\nargurr1ents of the assessees' counsel as if they were proved facts\nand basing its decision on them ; and, as the facts necessary to\nsupport the claim for exemption under s. 10 (2) (xv) had not been\nestablished at any stage of the case, the assessees were not entitled\nto the deduction cJ.imed. \"Agency\nLtd.(1 ) The Tribunal found as facts: (1) That the Ltd.\napplicant company agreed to pay off the decretal\namount from the remuneration which they are entitled o.\nK.,nia J.\nto get from the Basanti Cotton Mills. Instead of first ascertaining what were the facts found\nby the Tribunal in the present case, the process was\nreversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mit\nchell's case(1 as the law and argue that the facts in the\n)\npresent case covered the situation. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1013\nhave exposed the applicant company to the public and\n1950\nin order to save themselves from the scandal and main-\ntain the managing agency they agreed to the deduction\nCommissioner of\nof certain amounts from the managing agency commis. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section\n10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act on the ground that\nthe payment was an expenditure which was not in the\nnature of a capital expenditure or personal expenses of\nthe applicant company but was an expenditure laid\nout wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its busi\nness. At the third stage, when the assessee urged his conten\ntions before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he\nthought of urging as an argument that this was a per\nmissible deduction under section 10 (2) (xv) because of\nthe principles laid down in Mitchell's case(2). therefore, this appeal should be\nallowed on the simple ground that the facts necessary\nto be established by the respondents to support their\nclaim for exemption under section 10 (2) (xv) of the\nIndian Income-tax Act have not been established at\nany stage of the proceedings and therefore they are\nnot entitled to the deduction claimed. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1015\nnecessary facts in that connection was on the assessee,\n1950\nit being common ground that the commission was due -:--:-\nand had become payable and was therefore the business cc7m\"\"0 of\n,;.::m;;;:;'\":. The jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income\ntax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Inco:ne\ntax Act the decision of the Appellate Tribunal on facts is final\nunless it can be successfully assailed on the ground tha~ there wasS.C.R. The Appellate Tribunal found that the assessees had\nagreed to pay off the decree a1nount from the remuneration due to\nthem, that the decre.e was passed against them evidently for some\nmisfeasance committed by their directors, that the books of both\ncompanies showed that the assessees were paid their remunera\ntion in full, and that the expenditure was not therefore laid out\nfor the purpose of carrying on the business, and also that, as the\npayment was made for the liquidation of a debt, it was not a\nrevenue expenditure. The High Court overlooked that in Afitchell's\ncase(') the whole discussion started with a quotation\nfrom the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts\nof the case. (3) The books of account of Basanti\nCotton Mills Ltd. would show that they were paying\nthe applicant company in full its remuneration and\n.. the books of the applicant company also show that it\nwas entitled to its remuneration in full. They urged that if the applicant company did\nnot agree to pay this amount, Basanti Cotton Mills\nLtd. could have brought a suit against the company\nto realise this amount due on the hundis which would ••\nS.C.R. 719,\n1~9•\n·I'\n1010 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1950)\n1950 Judgment of the Calcutta High Court reversed. lt appears\nthat certain hundis were drawn by one of the directors\nof the respondent company, acting in the capacity of\nthe managing agents of the :Mill Company, in the name\nof the Mill Company and the same were negotiated to\nothers. J. d\na payment could be escribed as a business expenditure\nfalling within the terms of section 10 (2) (xv), argued\nthat the facts in the present case were the same. This statement of the case prepared by the Income\ntax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its\nopinion was perused by the parties and they had no\nsuggestions to make in respect of the same. The\nPatntalal\nrespondents cannot therefore claim that the loss of the\nJankid-:u\ngoods was explosion damage within the meaning of the\nv,\nOrdinance so as to bring the case within section 14 and\nMohanlal and\nAnother, at the same time contend that the loss was not \"due\nto or did not in any way arise ont of the explosion\" in\nPata1tjali order to a void the bar under section 18. One of the directors of the assessee company, acting in the\ncapacity of managing agents of certain l\\'fills, had dra\\vn some\nhundis in the name of tho Mills, aod as the Mills repudiated lia\nbility, suits were filed on the hundis against the Mills and the\nassessees.

  "summary": "ment of a public purpose were not a provision of\narticle 31 (2), then it will obviously lead us to the un-\ntenable conclusion that Parliament will be free under\nits residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of\nList I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac-\nquiring private property without any public purpose\nat all and to the still more absurd result that while\n•\nParliament will have to provide for compensation\nunder article 31 (2) in a law made by it for acquisitio•\nof property for a public purpose it will not have to\nmake any provision for compensation in a law made\nfor acquisition of property to be made without a public\npurpose. ulia, to matters specified in entry 33 in List I, namely,\n\"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur-\nposes of the Union, that the State Legislatures have\nexclusive power to make laws with respect, inter\nalia, to matters specified in entry 36 in List II, namely,\nthe \"acquisition or requisitioning of property except\nfor the purposes of the Union subject to the provision '\nof entry 42 of List III\" and that both Parliament and\nthe State Legislatures may make laws with respect to\nmatters set forth in entry 42 in List III, namely, the\nprinciples for determining the compensation and the\nform and manner of giving such compensation. Learned counsel stressed the words \"law\" and\n·•'legislature\" and submitted that, inasmuch as the\nlegislature of a State included the Governor (article\n116898 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952J\n1952\n168) and a bill could become a law only after the\nGovernor assented to it under article 200, clause (3) of\nThe State of\narticle 31 must be taken to require that a State law\nBihar\ny, authorising compulsory acquisition of property should )\nMaharaja rei;eive the Governor's as well as the President's\ndhirajaSir assent, the former to mab: it a law and the latter to\nKameshwar\ngive it \"effect\". 8-10 S.

If that entry by it-\n\"·\nself or read with entry 42 in List III has any impli-\ncation as suggested, namely, that a law for acquisition\nof property made under entry 36 in List II without a\nprovision for compensation wiJll be beyond the legis-\nlative compentency of the State \\Legislatures, then\nthere is no other entry under which such a law can be\nmade by a State Legislature and there can, therefore,\nbe no point in making a prOIVision in article 31(4) for\nprotecting, against article 31(2), a law which, on this\nhypothesis, cannot be made at all. The words \"sub-\nject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III\" in entry 36\nreinforce the argument, as these words must be taken\nto mean that the power to make a law with respect to\nacquisition of property should be exercised subject to\nthe condition that such law should also provide for\nthe matters referred to in entry 42 , in other words, a\ntwo-fold restriction as to public purpose and payment\n•\n.o f compensation (both of which are referred to in\n·entry 42) is imposed on the exercise of the law mak-\ning power under entry 36. The last mentioned words are, however,\nnot to be found l.n entry 33 in List I and this pan of\nMr. P. R. Das's argument would lead to this anomal-\nous result that while the obligation to provide for\ncompensation is made a part of the legislative power\nunder entry 36 in List II by virtue of its last few\nwords quoted above, no such obligation is attractedt\nand made part of the legislative power under entry 33\nin List I, and that, therefore, in making a law with\nrespect to acquisition of property under entry 33 in\nf. List I Parliament, unlike the State Legislatures, will\nnot be bound to provide for any compensation at all. Mr. P. R. Das finally urges that if the obligation to\nprovide for compensation is not implicit in the word\n\"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and if that obliga-\ntion is not to be read into that entry even in view of •\nthe words \"subject to .............. \" at the end of it,\neven then if the State exercises its power to make a\nlaw with respect to acquisition of property under\nentry 36 in List II it is the duty of the State Legisla- . \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of\nList !Ii\" do not import that obligation as stated\nabove, entry 42 in List III should, nevertheles~, be\nconstrued as conferring a power coupled with a duty,\nso that if the law-making power under entry 33 in\nList I or entry 36 in List II is at all exercised, the law-\nmaking power under entry 42 in List III must, on the\nprinciple laid down by the House of Lords in\n/ulus v. Lord Bishop of Oxford(') and adopted\nby this Court in Chief Controlling Revenue Autho\nrity v. Maharashtra Sugar Mills Ltd.('), also be exer-\ncised. implicit in entry 36 in List II and\nthat the existence of a public purpose is also a re-\nquirement of entry 42 in List III which is made a •\npart of entry 36 in List II by virtue of the words\n\"subject to\" etc., appearing at the end of that entry\nand his conclusion is that in the absence of a public •\npurpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com-\npetency under those two entries to enact the impug-\nned Act and that this ground of attack, is still availableS.C.R. On the other hand, even\nif i;t is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid\ndown by the Act, as contended, then that fact not\nonly amounts to a breach of the provisions of entry 42\nin List III but also constitues a breach of the provi-\nsions of article 31 (2) which clearly and emphatically re-\nquires the law to either fix the compensation or lay\ndown the principles on which and the manner in\nwhich the compensation· is to be given and a breach\nof this \"provision\", call it a provision of article 31 (2)\nor one of entry 42 in List III, cannot, for reasons\nalready stated be questioned in view of articles 31 ( 4),\n31-A and 31-B. The\nscheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the\nthree things separately, namely, the power of making a\nlaw for acquisition of property in article 246 read\nwith entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, the\n,\nobligation of such law to provide for compensation in\narticle 31 (2) and the power of making a law laying\ndown the ·p rinciples for determining such compen-\nsation in article 246 read with entry 42 in List III.S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 987\nbeing implicit in entry 36 in List II and entry 42 1952\nin List III and holds that the respondents are, by\nreason of the provisions of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and The State of\nBihar\n31-B, debarred from questioning the validity of the\n.. v.\nAct on the ground that it does not provide for compen- Maharaja\ns.i.tion the respondents are, nevertheless, entitled to dhiraja Sir\nchallenge the Act on the ground of the absence of a Kameshwar\nSingh\npublic purpose. This condition is implied in the\nprovision of :irticle 31 (2) of the Constitution and\nalthough the enactment in the present case fulfills\nthe requirements of clause (3) of article 31 and as958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 such attracts the operation of clause (4) of that\narticle, my learned brother has takien the view that\nThe State of\nthe bar created ·by cleause ( 4) is confined to the ques-\nBihar\nv. tion of compensation only and does not extend to the\nMaharaja existence or necessity of a public purpose which,\ndhiraja Sir though implicit in, has not been expressly provided\nKanieshwar\nfor by clause (2) of the article. The State of\nSome Courts have gone so far in the direction of a\nBihar\nliberal construction as to hold that \"public use\" is v.\nsynonymous with \"public benefit'', \"public utility\", ' Maharaia\nor \"public advantage\", and to authorise the dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nexercise of the power of eminent domain to pro-\nSingh\nmote such public benefit, etc., especially where\nof Darbhanga\nthe interests involved are of considerable magni- and Others. Assuming that the necessity for the existence of a\npublic purpose is not a provision of article 31 (2) but is\na provision only of entry 36 in List II and/or of\nentry 42 in List III and that consequently articles 31 ( 4 ),\n31-A and 31-B do not preclude the respondents from\nchallenging the validity of the Act on the ground of\nthe legislative incompetency arising out of the absence\nof a public purpose, the question still remains whether\nthere is in fact a public purpose within the meaning of\nour Constitution to support the Act. Article 31-A, sub-clause (1) is in these terms;:-\n,\n\"Notwithstanding anything m the foregoing\nprovisions of this Part, no law providing for the\n10~!0 S.C. India/7!1012 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952\nacquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights\ntherein or for the extinguishment or modification of any\nThe State of\nBihar such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ·ground\n1\nv. that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges l\nMaharaia any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this\nJhiraja Sir\nParr:\nKameshwar\nSingh Provided that where such law is a law made by the .•\nof Darbhanga\nLegislature of a. article 31 (2) and courts cannot examine either the\nextent or the adequacy of the prov1S1ons of com-\npensation contained in any law dealing with the936 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952\nacquisition of property compulsorily for public purpose\nbut the barring provisions of article 31(4) <lo not in any\nThe State of\nBihar way touch the powers of the court to see whether the\nv. acquisition has been made for public purpose. On\nthe other hand, the law referred to m article 31(4)\ncovers acquisition of any kind of property, while\n., article 31-A relates only to the acquisition of a parti-\ncular kind of property, viz., estates and rights there-\nin, and what is more important for our present\n..\npurpose, the non obstante clause in article 31 ( 4) over-\nrides all other provisions in the Constitution including\nthe List of the Seventh Schedule, whereas a law which\nfalls within the purview of article 31-A could only\nprevail over \"the foregoing provisions of this Part\". Emphasis is laid on the words \"subject to the provi-\nsions of entry 42\" contained in entry 36 and it is\ncontended that the exercise of legislative power under920 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 entry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under\nentry 42, that one could not be exercised without the\nThe State of\nother and that the power conferred by the two entries\nBihar\nv. had to be construed on the assumption that the acqui-\nMaharaia sitiop. The foundation of Mr. P. R. Das's attack on the\nvires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it\nis implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II\nof the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro-\nperty could not be acquired without payment of com-\npensation, the only effect of a compulsory power of\nacquisition against the individual being that there is\nthe power to oblige him to sell and convey property\nwhen the public necessities require it, but that the\npower to take compulsorily raises by implication a\nright to payment ; in other words, there is a con-\ncomitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire\nis inseparable from the obligation to pay compen-\nsation and as the provisions of the statute in respect\nof payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon-\nstitutional. If a State Legislature\nin making a law for the acquisition of property for a\npublic purpose under entry 36 in List II must pro-\nvide for compensation then a law made conformably\nwith this supposed requirement of that entry by a\nState Legislature will require no protection ar all\nagalnst article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-\ned as meaningless and unnecessary. 5-10 S. C. Tndiaf71932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 Lastly, it was urged that the legislative power\nconferred in entry 42 of the Concurrent List is a power\nThe State of\nconferred for the benefit of the expropriated owner\nBihar\nv. and that the legislature is bound to exercise this\nMaharaja power for his benefit whenever it takes property under\ndhiraja Sir its compulsory powers, in other words, it was said\nKameshwar\nthat the power conferred by the entry was coupled\nSingh\nwith a duty to exercise it. If the principles so laid down\nin the Act do not in any rare case produce any com-\npensation or do not produce adequate compensation\nin some cases, such absence of compensation may be\na contravention of article 31 (2) but in view of\narticles 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B and particularly due to\nthe words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitu-\ntion\" occurring in article 31 ( 4) it cannot be made a\nground of attack on the Act, even though such ground\nis formulated in a different but attractive language,\nnamely, as a fraud on the Constitution. I am, however, free to confess that if I could\nagree with Mr. P. R. Das that these provisions\n.o f the impugned Act are bad for want of a public\npurpose, I am not at all sure that I would not have\nfound it extremely difficult to resist his further\nargument that the entire Act was bad, for it might1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 not have been very easy to presume that if the Bihar\nLegislature had known that these provisions of the\nT lze State of\nAct might be held bad it would nevertheless have\nBihar\nv. passed the other parts of the Act in that truncated\nMaharaja form. I have already dealt with the question of\nabsence of a provision for just compensation while\ndealing with Mr. P. R. Das's first point and I repeat\nthat the obligation to provide for compensation is not\nimplicit in entry 36 List II by itself or read with\nentry 42 in Lisit: III but is to be found only in\narticle 31 (2), that under entry 42 in List III the Act\nhas laid down a principle for determining compensa-\ntion and, therefore, there can be no question as to\nlegislative incompetency for any alleged non-compli-\nance with any supposed requirement said to be im-\nplicit . Further, Mr. P. R. Das reads\nthe words \"subject to\" as meaning \"conditional upon\"\nThe State of\nthe exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 in\nBihar\nv. List III, that is to say, conditional upon fulfilling the\nMaharaja obligation to provide for compensation and the form\ndhiraja Sir\nand the manner in which such compensation is to be\nKameshwar\ngiven. It is, therefore, concluded that the only \"pro-\nvision\" of article 31 (2) is that the law autho-\nrising the taking of possession or the acquisition\nof property for a public purpose must provide\nfor compensation and it is this \"provision\" only\nthat cannot be made a ground of attack on the\nAct by reason of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B of\nthe Constitution. If the \"provision\" of clause (2)\nof article 31 as to the necessity for the existence of a\npublic purpose as a prerequisite to compulsory acquisi-\ntion of property is also to be regarded as implicit in\nthose two legislative entries, surely articles 31 (4),\n31-A and 31-B and in particular article 31 (4) which\ncontain the words \"notwithstanding anything in this\nConstitution\" will protect the Act from such implied\nprov!S!on, for reasons I have already explained. When\nwe come to entry 42 of List III (Concurrent List), we\nfind these words : \"Principles on which compensation\nfor property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes1008 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952\nof the Union or of a State or for any other public pur-\npose is to be determined, and the form and the manner\nThe State of\nBihar in which such compensation is to be given.\" The words \"subject to\" in entry 36 of List II only mean\nthat whenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exercise\nof its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be subject\nto the provisions of a law made by the Parliament under entry 42 •\nof List III. in entry 36 in List II\nthe Legislature of a State can only make a law for\ncompulisory acquisition of property for a public pur-\npose, Parliament may, under entry 33 in Llst I which\ndoes not attract entry 42 in List III, make a law for\ncompulsory acquisition of property without a public\npurpose. It was said that the words \"subject to the\nBihar\nv. provisions of entry 42 in List III\" must be taken to\nMaharaja mean that the law-making power under entry 36\ndhiraja Sir could only be exercised subject to the two conditions\nKrlmeshwar\nas to public purpose and payment of compensation,\nSingh\nof Darbhanga both of which are referred to in entry. There is no doubt that\n\"land\" in entry 18 in List II has been construed in a\nvery wide way but if \"land\" or \"land tenures\" in that\nentry is held to cover acquisition of land also, then\nentry 36 in List II will have to be held as wholly\nredundant, so far as acquisition of land is concerned, a\nconclusion to which I am not prepared to assent. Further, it must be borne in mind that\nBihar\narticle 31 ( 4) which applies \"notwithstanding any-\nv.\nthing in this Constitution'', will, by force of the very Maharaja\nwords, protect the Act against everi legislative in- dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\ncompetency, if any arising out of the alleged non-\nSingh\ncompliance with the suggested implied provisions, if\nof Darbhanz11\nany, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III.

This head of legislation seems to have been expressly\nmentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of\nthe accepted principle of law that in cases of compul-\nsory acquisition of property compensation has to be\nmade but also in view of the clear and mandatory\nprovisions of article 31(2) which require that a law\nauthorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will\nbe void if it does not provide for payment of compen-\nsation for the property acquired or does not either fix\nthe amount of compensation or specify the principles\non which and the manner in which the compensation\nis to be determined and given. Mr. P. R. Das suggests, in the alternative, that if\nthe obligation to provide for compensation is not\nimplicit in the word \"acquisition\" itself as used in\nentry 36 in List II that obligation is a~tracted and\nmade a part and pared of that entry by reason of\nthe words \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of\nList III\". In the face of the limitations on the\nState's power of compulsory acquisition t'hus incor-\nporated in the body of the Constitution, from which\n\"estates\" alone are excluded, it would, in my opinion,\nbe contrary to elementary canons of statutory con-\nstruction to read, by implication, those very limita-\ntions into entry 36 of List II, alone or in conjunction\nwith entry 42 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, or to\ndeduce them from \"the spirit of the Constitution\",\nand that, too, in respect of the very properties\nc\nexcluded. 7-10 S.

TIJils obliganbn to provide for compen-\nsation is no doubt one of the provisions of articles 31\n(2) but if, as contended by Mr. P. R.

It is in order to prevent this argument\nand out of aqundant caution that - the subject-\nmatter of entry 42 in List III has been excluded\nfrom the content of entry 36. in List II by the words\n\"subject to\" et cetera and Parliament may, therefore,\nfreely make a law with respect to the matters thus\nexcluded from entry 36 in List II and set forth as a\nseparate and independent item in entry 42 'in List III. manner of doubt that acquisition of private property\nby legislation under entries 33, 36 and 42 can only be\nmade either for purposes of the Union or for purposes\nof the State or for a public purpose and that it is un-\n•1ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself\ntne precise purpose for which property is being taken,\nnrovided from the whole tenor and inten<lment of the\nAct it could be gathere<l that the property was being\nacquired either for purposes of the State or for pur-\nposes of the public and that the intention was to\nbenefit the community at large. On a proper interpretation of articles 245 and\n246 read with entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in968 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 List III the Bihar Legislature had no power to enact\nthe said Act inasmuch as it makes no provision for the\nThe State of\npayment of just compensation . under entry 36 and entry 42 and intended to take the\nproperty conditional on payment of compensation but\nif it transpires that the provisions it has made about\npayment of compensation are illusory, then that part\nof the Act would be void and as it could not have been\nintended by the legislature to pass the Act in any\ntruncated form in which it would remain if the provi-\nsions regarding compensation are taken out of it, the\nwhole Act should be held unconstitutional.

For a proper appreciation and appraisal of the pro-\nposition of Mr. P. R. Das that the obligation to pay\ncompensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of\nList II of the Seventh Schedule and that the power to\ntake compulsorily raises by implication a right to\npayment, the power to acquire being inseparable from\nthe obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to\nexamine briefly the origin of the power of the State on\nthe subject of compulsory acquisition of property. Article 31 (4), for instance, speaks of a \"bill\"\nbeing reserved for the President's assent \"after it has\nbeen passed\" by the \"legislature of a State\" and of\n\"the law so assented to.\" On\na plain reading of entry 36 in List II the power to\nmake law with respect to matters specified therein is\n\"subject to\", that is to say, \"conditional upon\" the\nexercise of legislative power under entry 42 in List III. The\nexpress provision in article 31 (2) that a law of\nacquisition, in order to be valid, must provide for\ncompensation, will, therefore, necessarily exclude all\nsuggestion of an implied obligation to provide for\ncompensation sought to be impo.i;.ted into the meaning\nof the word \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II. It follows, therefore, that what is sought\nto be protected by article 31 (4) is a law for the acqui-\nsition or taking possession of property which does not,\namongst other things, pro-ifide for compensation or\n126978 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 does not fix the amount or specify the principles on\nwhich and the manner in which the compensation is\nThe State of\nBihar to be determined and given, for otherwise there would\nv. be no necessity for any protection.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 975\nAccording to this scheme it is not necessary at all 1952\nto regard entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II,\nThe State of\nwhich are mere heads of legislative power, as contain-\nBihar\ning within themselves any obligafion to provide for the\nv.\npayment of compensation.

The\nThe State of\nopening words of article 31-B are only intended to\nBihar\nmake clear that article 31-A should not be restricted v.\nin its application by reason of anything contained in Maharaja\narticle 31-B and are in no way calculated to restrict dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nthe application of the latter article or of the enactments\nSingh\nreferred to therein to acquisition of \" estates. \" SUPREME COURT REPORTS 913\non the motion that it be passed into law, as required 1952\nby the provisions of rule 20 (1) of the rules governing\nThe State of\nlegislative business then in force, and that the omis-\nBihar\nsion was not a mere \"irregularity of procedure\" which\nv.\n• the court is barred from enquiring into under article Maharaja\n212 (1) of the Constitution. under heads (2) and (3) of sub- •\nclause (b) must necessarily be referable to, and derive\ntheir competence from the legislative power under\nentry 36 of List II, in so far as they purport to autho-\n..\nrise acquisition of any property, for the police power\nof the State is only the general power to regulate and\ncontrol the exercise of private rights and lioerties in\nthe interests of the community and does not represent\nany specific head of legislative power. a:i the interest of the community so requires, the\nThe State of\nState may, under article 31, deprive the owner of his Bihar\nproperty by authority of law subject to payment of v.\ncompensation if the deprivation is by way of acquisi- Maharaia\ndhiraia Sir\ntion or requisition of the property by the State. That the obligation to provide for compensation is\nnot included in the content of the legislative power\nu_nder entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry\n42 in List III, will be made further clear when we come\n• to consider closely clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and\narticle 31-A. I am therefore of the\nopinion that Mr. Das is not right in his contention\nthat unless adequate provision is made by a law en-\nacted under legislative power conferred by entry 36 of\nList I for compensation, the law is unconstitutional ,,\nas entry 36 itself does not authorize the making of\nsuch a law without providing for compensation. the descriptive words under the legislative head\n- \"collection of rents\" are wide .enough to permit k~-\n'\nlation in respect of remission ·of rents and that under\nitem 22 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the\nlegislative head \"forests\" include the power to legis-\nlate with respect not only to afforestation but also to\ndisafforestation and that the legislative head \"fisheries\"\nwould include the power to legislate on the prohibi-\ntion of fishing altogether. Both legislatures can legislate under\nentry 42 but the Parliamentary statute made in\nexercise of powers under this entry would have pre-\nference over a State law in case of repugnancy and it\nwas for this reason that reference was made to entry 42\nin the head of legislation mentioned in the State List\nunder entry 36. (iii) Section 32(2) of the Act which empowers the State -\nGovernment to frame rules providing for \"the proportion in\nwhich compeinsation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and\n·the manner of payment pf such compensation\" does not involve\nany delegation of legislative powers especially as the legislature\nhas itself provided in s. 32(2) that the compensation shall be\npayable in cash or in bonds . Article 31(4) postu-\nlates a law which offends against 31(2) and so far as the\nState Legislatures are concerned there is no entry in\nList II except entry 36 under which such an offending\nlaw may made by the State Legislatures. Mr. Sanjiva Chowdhuri has urged that the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894 being continued by the Con-\nstitution and that Act which is a Central Act having\n•\nbeen extended by notilication in 1899 to Ramgarh\nState for which he appears, the Central Act must\napply to Ramgarh until the notification is withdrawn\nand the impugned Act cannot apply for determining\nthe compensation, for the field is already occupied by\nthe Central Act of 1894. The provisions of articles 31(4) and\n31-A and 31-B, though they deprive the expropriated\nproprietor of his rights provided in Part III of the\nConstitution, do not in any way affect the ambit of\nentry 36 and empower the State Legislature to make\na law for compulsory acquisition of property without\npayment of compensation in the true sense of that term. Assuming however that entry 36 of List II is wide\nenough to include acquisition of money or a right of\naction, I have no hesitation in holding that in Qr~vid­\nJ\ning for compensation in respect of such acquisition the\nlegislature has made a colourable use of entry 4:l oi\nList III and has thereby defeated the purpose of that\nentry altogether. The existence of a\npublic purpose as a condition precedent to the exercise\nof the power of compulsory acquisition being then, as\nI hold, a \"provision\" of article 31 (2), an infringement\nof such a provision cannot, under articles 31 (4), 31-A\nand 31-B, be put forward as a ground for questioning\nthe validity of the Act.

The argument is that the Constitution has left to\nParliament or the State Legislature the duty of specify-\ning the principle on which, and the form and manner\nin which the compensation is to be determined and\ngiven but the Bihar Legislature by section 3 (22) of\nthe Act has simply provided that the amount of com-\npensation shall be paid i:n cash or in bonds or partly\nin cash and partly in bonds and that the bonds shall\nbe either negotiable or non-negotiable and non-trans-\nferable and be payable in forty equal instalments and\nhas 'not laid down any decisive provision but has left\nthe matter to the State Government to decide. The question for consideration is whether this\nobligation to pay compensation for compulsory\nacquisition of property has been impliedly laid down\nby the constitution makers in our Constitution under\nlegislative head in entry 36 of List II and entry 33 of\nList I, or whether this all important obligation which\nfollows ocmpulsory acquisition as a shadow has been\nput in express and clear terms somewhere else in the\n.~. PATANJALI SAsTRI C.

The only\npurpose of the words \"subject to\" occuring in\nentry 36 is to indicate that legislation under entry 36\nwould be subject to any law made by Parliament in\nexercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of the\nConcurrent List. It is\nby force of the provisions of article 31 (2) that it be-\ncomes obligatory to legislate providing for compen-\nsation under entry 42 of the Concurrent List in order\nto give validity to a law enacted under entry 36 and\nnot by reason of the use of the words \"subject to\" in\nthe wording of the entry. acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights\ntherein or for the extinguishment or modification of Mahajan/,\nany such rights shall be deemed to be void on the\nground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or\nabridges any of the rights conferred by any pro-\nvisions of this Part :\nProvided that where such law is a law made by\nthe Legislature of a State, the provisions of this\nArticle shall not apply thereto unless such law,\nhaving been reserved for the consideration the Presi-\ndent has received his assent.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS\nentry 42 in List III confers a power on the Legisla- 1952\nture for the protection of the interest of persons; whose\nThe State of\nproperty is compulsunly acquired, such power must,\nBihar\n• therefore, be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer-\nv.\ncise it. The fact is that the law-making power of both Parlia-\nment and State Legislatures can be exercised only\n• subject to the aforesaid two restrictions, not by reason\nof anything contained in the entries themselves, but\nby reason of the positive provisions of article 31 (2),\nand, as laws falling under article 31 ( 4) or under\narticles 31-A and 31-B cannot be called in question\nin a court of law for non-compliance with those pre>-\nvisions, such laws cannot be struck down as uncon-\nstitutional and void. Section 4 (b) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act lays\ndown, as one of the results of the publication of a\nnotification under section 3(1) of tl1e Act that \"all\narrears of rents........ and all cesses together with\ninterest, if any, due thereon for any period prior to\nthe date of vesting which were recoverable in respect\nof the estate or tenure by the proprietor or tenure-\nholder and the recovery of which was not barred by\nany law of limitation shall vest in and be recoverable\nby the State\". It provides :-\n\"If any Bill pending at the commencement of this\nConstitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it\nhas been passed by such Legislature, beert reserved for\nthe consideration of the President and has received\n•\nhis assent, then, notwithstanding anything m this\nConstitution, the law so assented to shall not be called\nin question in any court on the ground that it contra-\nvenes the provisions of clause (2).\" The\nprovision of clause (2) is only as regards compen-\nsation as can be gathered from its latter part :-\n\"Unless the law provides 'for · compensation for\nthe property taken possession of or acquired and either\nfixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the\nprinciples on which, and the manner in which, the\ncompensation is to be determined and given.\" Hence article 31(4), in my opinion, does v.\nnot bar the jurisdiction of the court from inquiring Maharaja\nwhether the law relating to compulsory acquisition of dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nproperty is not valid because the acquisition is not\nSingh\nbeing made for a public purpose. tion is, according to him, implicit 'in entry 36 in\nList II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, and\nthere is no other entry under which a law may be\nmade by a State Legislature with respect to acquisi-\nf1on of property. For all these 1952\nreasons the State Legislatures, it was claimed, had no\nThe State of\npower to make a law for acquisition of property with-\nBihar\nout fulfilling the two conditions as to public purpose\nv •\n.and payment of compensation. That result may offend aga·1nst the\nprovisions of article 31 (2) but certainly not against\nentry 42 in List III and in view of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A\nand 31-B the Act cannot be challenged for non-com-\npliance with article 31 (2). A law of this 1952\nkind, in so far as such law provides for acquisition of\nThe State of\nproperty, must necessarily be made by a State Legis-\nBihar\n• lature, if at all, under entry 36 in List II. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 943\nproposition of law that property of individuals can- 1952\nnot be appropriated by the State under the power of\nThe State of\ncompulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding\nBihar\nto the revenues of the State. Mr. Choudhury contended that the\nfield of legislation on the question of principles of\ndetermination of compensation and the mode and\nmanner of payment of such compensation was already\noccupied by the Land Acquisition Act which was an\nexisting law of Parliament and, t~refore, the State\nI Legislature could not enter on this field and legislate\non the principles of payment of compensation. In other words, it only means that\nwhenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exer-\ncise of its legislative power under entry 36, that law\nwill be subject to the provisions of a Parliamentary\nstatute made in exercise of its legislative powers\nunder entry 42 of the C'nncurrent List. But, when these limitations are expressly pro-\nvided for and it is further enacted that no law shall\nbe made which takes away or abridges these safe-\nguards, and any such law, if made, shall be void,\nthere can be no room for implication, and the words\n\"acquisition of property\" must be understood in their\nnatural sense of the act of acquiring property, without\nimporting into the phrase an obligation to payS.C.R. Lis:t II, it is convenient now to examine the conten-\n..\ntion of Mr. Das to the effect that in the contents of\nthe power conferred on the legislature by this entry\ntheir exists a concomitant obligation to pay compen-\nsation and that as the provisions regarding payment of\ncompensation are illusory, the Act i:s unconstitutional\nand that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution does not\nafford any protection against this attack. Clause (4) of that\narticle postulates a \"law\" authorising acquisition\nof property but contravening the provisions of\n)\nclause (2), that is, without a public purpose or pay-\nment of compensation. Further, the impugned Act purports to\nMaharaja acquire all arrears of rent and a la~ for acquisition of\ndhiraja Sir\nthe arrears of rent cannot possibly be said to be a\nKameshwar\nlaw with respect to matters specified in entry 18\nSingh\n..\nof Darbhanga in List II for it cannot be supposed to be a law\nand Others.

Possibly under the impression that the sacredness of\nprivate property should not be confided to the un-\ncertain virtues of the party in power for the time\nbeing, the Constitution-makers of our country have\ndeclared it as one of the fundamental rights that no\nproperty shall be taken possession of or acquired for\npublic purpose unless the law directing its appropriation\n.. makes provision for compensation in the manner laid\ndown in article 31 ( 2). This vesting of the\narrears of rent in the State necessarily implies the\ntransfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure-\nholders to the State and this process must, therefore,\namount to the acquisition of that right by the State,\nTherefore, in effect, the Act does contemplate the\nacquisition of the arrears of rent by the State.

That entry cannot possibly\nbe regarded as a legislative head for acquisition\nof property and much less is the purpose or\nprovince of that entry to lay down any requirement\nof a public purpose as a condition precedent for the992 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 acqms1t10n of any property. In the view I have expressed above that the objec-\ntions based on the lack of a public purpose and the\nfailure to provide for payment of just compensation\nare barred under article 31(4) and are also devoid of\nof merits, it becomes unnecessary to consider what is\na public purpose and whether the acquisition autho-\nrised by the impugned statutes subserves any public\npurpose.

The city\nobjected on the ground that the public landing had\nbecome property dedicated to the public under an\nearlier contract and to allow the condemnation under a1018 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 statute of Ohio was an impairment of the contract, l\nforbidden by the 10th section of the first article of the\nThe State of\nConstitution of the United States. v.\nMaharaja\n~horn of all its incidents,· the simple definition of dhiraja Sir\nthe power to acquire compulsorily or of the term Kameshwar\n\"eminent domain\" is the power of the sovereign to Singh\nof Darbhanga\ntake property for public use.

For if the restrictive condi-\ntions as to public purpose and pay_ment of compensa•\ntion are to be derived only from those words, then it\nmust follow that in the absence of those words in\nentry 33, Parliament can make laws authorising\nacquisition or requisitioning of property without a\npublic purpose and a provision for compensation.

On\nthe face of it the legislative provision purports to\nhave been made in exercise of the powers conferred on\nthe State legislature under entry 36 of List II and\nentry 42 of List III of Schedule, VII of the Constitu-\ntion. Their main attack was really\ngrounded on the absence of these two essential ..~ re­\nrequisites of valid legislation authorising acqms1t1on\nof private property, though Mr. Das would deduce\nthem by implication from entry 36 of List II and\nentry 42 of List III, while Dr. Ambedkar sought to\nderive them from the spirit of the Constitution. If the expression \"passed\nby the legislature\" were taken to mean \"passed\nby the Houses of the legislature and assented to\nby the Governor\" as Mr. Somayya would have\nit understood, then, it would cease to be a \"bill\"\nand could no longer be reserved as such. In the first place the existence of a public\npurpose being, as I hold, a provision of article 31 (2),\nits absence, if any, in relation to the arrears of\nrent cannot, by reason of articles 31 (4), 31-A and\n31-B be made a ground of attack against the Act. Firstly, it was said that the Constitution\n).,\nhaving _in entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule\nvested authority in the legislature to make laws on\nthe question of the principles as to the payment of\ncompensation and the manner and form of its payment,\nin other words, it h;, ving trusted these matters to the\ncare, judgment and wisdom of the legislature, it had\nno power to delegate these matters to the executive. The existence of a public purpose and an\nobligation to pay compensation being thus the neces-\nsary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of private\nproperty, the term \"acquisition\" must be construed\nas importing, by necessary implication, the two condi-\ntions aforesaid. The existence of a \"public\n..\npurpose\" is undoubtedly an implied condition of the\n~\nexercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the\nState, but the language of article 31(2) does not\nAS.C.R.

In my\njudgment, for the reasons stated above, the major\npremise in the arguments advanced by Mr. P. R. Das\nunder the first head, namely, that the obligation to\npay compensation is implicit in entry 36 in List II by\nitself or read wiith entry 42 in list III is unsound. -\nPer DAs J.-No hard and fast definition can be laid down\nas to what is a \"public purpose\" as tho concept has been\nrapidly changing in all countries, but it is clear that it is the •\npresence of the element of general interest of the community in\nan object or an aim that transforms such object or aim into a\npublic purpose, and whatever furthers the general interest\nof the community as opposed to the particular interest of the\nindividual must be regarded as a pnblic purpose. Entry 42 in List III\nonly constitutes a legislative head under which Parlia-\nment or the State Legislatures may make a law so as\nto give effect to the obligation expressly imposed on\nthem by article 31 (2). It is impos.•iblc\nTiu State of\nto deny that the Act is inspired and dominated by a\nBihar\nv. public purpose, but the question still remains whether\nMaharaja~ the taking over of particular items can be said to be for\ndhiraja Sir a public purpose. These provisions, so far as they are material\nhere, ~ ·e (i) that a law with respect to acquisition of\n• property ~hould authorize acquisition only for a\n...., public purpose and (ii) that such law should provide\nfor compensation, etc. MAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal under article 132(3)\nof the Constitution of India from a judgment of the\nFull Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna,\ndated the 12th March, 1951, whereby the High Court\ndeclared the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, ultra vires\non the ground of its infringement of article 14 of the\nConstitution, but decided against the respondent on\nall other points. 1952\nIt assumes that compulsory acquisition can be for a\nThe State of\n\"public purpose\" only, which is thus inherent in such\nBihar\nacquisition. Section 43 (2) (p) being thus void and inoperative,\nsection 32 (2) must also fall to the ground, being\nvague and incapable by itself of being 'given effect\nto, <Jnd, as payment of compensation was an inextri-\ncable part of the scheme of acquisition under the Act,\nthe entire Act must go. the alternative, the words \"subject to the provisions\nof entry 42 of List III\" occurring at the end of entry\n36 in List II certainly brings in that obligation. Clause ( 4) (b) of the impugned Act read with the\nprovision of section 24 of the same, empowers the\nState Government to appropriate all the arrears of\nrent due to a landlord at a particular time and the\nonly obligation it casts on the Government in this\nrespect is to allow 50\"/o of the amount thus appro-\npriated as sol'lllium for the so-called acquisition. 283\nto 295 of 1951 (relating to the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Aboli-\ntion and Land Reforms Act, 1950).894 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 The Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary\nRights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950\nThe State of\n(No. Nor is it claimed, in\nview of articles 31(4 ), 31-A and 31-B, that it is still\nopen to the respondents to call in question the valid-\nity of the impugned Act on the ground that it\ncontravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or\nabridges the provision for compensation made in\narticle 31(2). True, compensation has to be\nprovided for, by reason of sub-clause (2) of the article,\nbut sub-clause ( 4) postulates an exception and the\nright to challenge the validity of the Act on the ground\nthat no compensation has been provided for or that the\ncompensation is really illusory or inadequate ts taken\naway. Power to take was mentioned in entry 36,\nwhile the condition for the exercise of· that power\nwas embodied in article 31 (2) and there was no duty\nto pay compensation implicit in the content of the\nentry itself. I do not, however, see how the above observations\nof Mukherjea J. in any way support the argument of\nMr. P. R. Das that the existence of a public purpose is\nnot a provision of article 31 (2) but is an inherent\ncondition of any legislation for compulsory acquisition\nof private property. Per MAHAJAN J.-The phrase \"public purpose\" hao to be\nconstrued according to the spirit of the times in which the parti-\ncular legislation is enacted and so construed, acquisition of estates\nfor the purpose of preventing the concentration of huge blocks of\nland in the hands of a few individuals and to do away with\nintermediaries is for a public purpose. As the\nAct has been held' invalid by the High Court solely on\nthe ground that it violated the provisions of article 14\nof the Constitution, the basis of the judgment declaring\nthe Act to be unconstitutional is no longer tenable\nand it has therefore to be reversed in case this Court\nagrees with the decision of the High Court oii the\npoints decided against the respondent. The entries in the Lists of the\nThe State of\nSeventh Schedule are designed to define and delimit\nBihar\nthe respective areas of legislative competence of the v.\nUnion and State Legislatures, and such context is Maharaja\nhardly appropriate for the imposition of implied res- dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\ntriictions on the exercise of legislative powers, which\nSingh\nare ordinarily matters for positive enactment in the\nof Darbhang11\nbody of the Constitution.

The obligation to\npay compensation may be introduced as a· part of the\nlegislative power itself, in which case it becomes a\ncomposite power, namely, a power to make law with\nrespect to acqui.sition circumscribed by the· obligation\nto provide for compensation. It would, there-\nfore, follow that whereas under entry 36 in List II\nwhich is to be read with entry 42 in List III by reason\nof the words \"subject to\" etc. In other words,\narticle 31 (2) must be understood as also providing\nthat legislation authorising expropriation of private\nproperty should be lawful only if it was required for\na public purpose and provision was made for pay-\nment of compensation. The argument of Shri P. R. Das that the payment\nof compensation is a concomitant obligation to the\ncompulsory acquisition of properties by the State can\nbe accepted as sound ; but when he went further and\nurged that it was found in an implicit form in entry 42\nof the Concurrent List, he was by no means on sure\nground.

This was precisely the\nv.\nobjection raised both by Mr. Das and Dr. Ambedkar Maharaja\nto the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes, dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nand such objection really amounts to calling those\nSingh\nlaws in question on the ground that they contravened\nof Darbhang•\nthe provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel and Others. Mr.\nBroom in his work on Constitutional Law says, \"Next\nin degree to the right of personal liberty is that of\nenjoying private property without undue interference\nor molestation, and the requirement that property\nshall not be taken for public use without just compen-\nsation is but an aflirmance of the great doctrine esta-\nblished by the common law for the protection of pri-\nvate property. The Bill which subsequently became \"The Bihar\nLand Reforms Act, 1950\" was pending at the com-\nmencement of the Constitution in the legislature of\nthe State, and after it was passed by the legislature,\nit was reserved for the consideration of the President\nand received his assent. 285 of 1951 preferred by the Raja of\nKapurthala, where a similar objection was raised, it\nwas further alleged that the privy purse of the Ruler\nwas fixed at a low figure in consideration of the Oudh\nc.\n4-10 S.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 939\nFor the reasons given above, I hold that the 1952\nimpugned Act does not fall for want of a public\nThe State of\npurpose\". From this survey of the Act it appears that the\nlaw enacted might be taken to relate to several items\nin the legislative lists, i.e., rights in or over land and\nland tenures, forests, fisheries, mines and minerals,\nacquisition of property and also principles on which\ncompensation for property acquired is to be deter-\nmined. If, however, the\nSingh\nof Darbhanga word \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and entry\nand Others. dhiraja Sir 1139-40 quoted by S. K. Das J. of the Patna High\nKameshwar\nCourt summarises the position thus :-\nSingh\nof Darbhanga \"No satisfactory definition of the term \"public use\"\nand Others. That the obligation to\npay just compensation for compulsory acquisition of\nprivate property is a principle of natural equity re-\ncognised by all temperate and civilized governments,\nthat the right to compensation is an incident to the\nexercise of the power of eminent domain and that the\none is so inseparably connected with the other that\nthey may be siaid to exist, not as separate and distinct\nprinciples but, as parts of one and the same principle\nare well-established by a series of decisions of the\nAmerican courts quoted by Harlan J. in Chicago, Bur\nlinghton and Quincy. In view of the Amendment Act any\nargu_ment regarding the unconstitutionality of the\nBihar Act based on the ground that the prov1s1ons\nof that Act contravened articles 14, 19 or 31\nof the Constitution does not survive and the Act is\n-\nnot open to challenge on any such ground. It is further contended that\ndhiraja Sir the legislative power in entry 42 is a power coupled with\nKameshwar\ndnty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the\nSingh\nbenefit of the person whose property was taken in exer-\nof Darbhanga\nand Others. The words \"for public purposes\" do occur\nin article 31 (2) but it is said that there is a distinction\nbetween a \"provision\" and an assumption. Be that as it\nBihar\n• may, it seems to me that m spite of the criticism\nv.\nlevelled against the Act by the learned counsel, it Maliaraja\ncannot be said that the Act would fall because it fails dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nto postulate a public purpose. The Amendment Act thus pro-\nvides no immunity from attacks based on the lack of\nlegislative competence under article 246, read with the\nentries in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule to\nthe Constitution to enact the three impugned statutes,\nas the Amendment Act d!d not in any way affect the\nLists. So far as the United States v.\nare concerned, the Fifth Amendment by providing Maharaja\ndhiraja Sir\nthat private property shall not be taken for public use\nKam~shwar\nwithout just compensation gave a constitutional recog-\nSingh\nnition to the right of eminent domain and, to protect of Darbhangt¥\nthe subjects, imposed a limitation on the exercise of that and Others. The court through\nBihar\nv. Mr. Justice Lurton held : ''The constitutional inhibition\nMaharaja upon any state law impairing the obligation of contracts\nJhiraja Sir is not a limitation upon the power of eminent domain. The exercise of the power to acquire\ncompulsorily is conditional on the existence of a public\npurpose and that being so, this condition is not an\nexpress provision of article 31(2) but exists aliunde\nin the content of the power itself and that in fact is\nthe assumption upon which this clause of the article\nproceeds. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 973\nthe United States by any provision of the Federal 1952\nConstitution, but this power has always been recog-\nThe State of\nnised to exist as an inherent attribute of the Bihar\n•\nsovereignty of the State. But, as Cooley has pointed out(3), taking money under\nthe right of eminent domain when it must be\neompc\"'ated by money afterwards could be nothing\nmor-e or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to\nsay Stat it comes under the head of acquisition or re-\nquisitioning of property as described !n entry 36 of\nList II and is embraced within its ordinary connot-\nation. The contention is that the\npublic purpose must be something definite, something\ntangible and something immediate and that there must\nbe some indication of its existence in the Act itself and\nthat the State cannot take private property to-day and\nsay that it will think of the public purpose at its\nleisure. Further,\nit must always be borne in mind that the object of\n.the impugned Act is not to authorise the stray acquisi-\ntion of a particular property for a limited and narrow\npublic purpose but that its purpose is to bring the\nbulk of the land producing wealth under State\nownership or control by the abolition of the system\nof land tenure which has been found to be archaic\nand non-conducive to the general interest of the\ncommunity. Again, article 31 ( 4) excludes attack\nonly on the ground of contravention of article 31 (2),\nwhile article 31-A bars objections based on contraven-\n) tion of other provisions of Part III as well, such as\narticles 14 and 19. Learned\ncounsel, however, maintain that although they cannot\nnow challenge the constitutionality of the Act on the\nground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or\ntakes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by\nany of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution ;\nit is, nevertheless, open to them to call the Act into\nquestion on other grounds founded on other parts of\nthe Constitution or on general principles of law. In Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal\nHotel Limited (supra) Lord Dunedin pointed out that\nthe power of acquisition was, in its origin, derived\nfrom the prerogative of the Crown and that the pay-\n-\nment of compensation was originally a matter of\nnegotiation and bargain between the Crown and the\nsubject, but came to be determined later on by statutes\nof local application and finally by statutes of general •\napplication and that, therefore, the Crown, which is\nan assenting party to every statute, must, in effect, be\nregarded as having consented to the exercise of its\nprerogative being made subject to payment of compen-\nsation regulated by statutes. We have been referred to some American authorities\nfor ascertaining the meaning and implication of \"public\nuse\", an expression which obviously is of a more\nlimited import than the expression \"public purpose\"\nused in our Constitution. Article 31 (4) and the\nadded articles debar the respondents from questioning\nthe validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia, that\nit contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or\nabridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions\nof clause (2) of article 31. contends that the impugned Act is a law made with\nrespect to matters mentioned in entry 18 in List II and\nnot under entry 36 in List II. Reference was made to\nsection 32(2) of the Act which runs as follows :-\n\"The amount of compensation so payable in terms\nof a compensation Assessment-roll as finally published\nshall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and\npartly in bonds. It may be that\nthe determination of the equivalent may be left\nfor ascertainment on the basis of certain uniform rul('s;950 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521\n1952 for instance, it may be laid down that the principles\nfor determining compensation will be the rental basis or\nThe State of\nthe market value of the property etc. As I explained in Gopalan's\ncase (') and again in Chiranjit Lat's case (supra) our\nConstimtion protects the freedom of the citizen by\narticle 19(1) (a) to ( e) and (g) but empowers the State,\neven while those freedoms last, to impose reasonable\nres~rictions on them in the interest of the State or of\npublic order or morality or of the general public as\nmentioned in clauses (2) to (6). It is in thi~ connection that the two\nKameshwar\nitems of \"arrears of rent\" and \"cost of works of benefit\nSingh\nof Darbhan ga to the raiyats\" dealt with in section 4, clause (b), and\nand Others. As regards the new articles 31-A and 31-B, they\nmerely place beyond the reach of the c;ourt any enact-\nment dealing with compulsory acquisition of property\nwhich may infringe any of the provisions of Part III\nof the Constitution ; in other words, article 13(2) of\nthe Constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the\nvalidity of such statutes.

Apart from this, a perusal\nof the text books, e.g., Constitutional Law by Professor\nWillis, p. 817 et seq., will immediately make it clear994 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 that the notion as to what is a \"public use\" is rapidly\nchanging in America. The company objected to the acquisi-\ntion on the strength of article l, Paragraph 10, of the\nU. S. Constitution which forbids any State to\npass a law impairing the obligation of contracts\nand was not \"due process of law\" as required by\nthe 14th Amendment. In my opinion, this is a mere device or pretence\nand the real object which the legislation intended to\naccomplish is to deprive a man of his money which is\nnot ordinarily a subject-matter of acquisition, in exer-\ncise of what are known as powers of eminent domain\nby the State, without giving him anything in ex-\nchange; and under the guise of acting under entry 42\nof List III, the legislature has in truth and substance\nevaded and nullified its provisions altogether. It was conceded by\nthe learned ,Advocate-General of 'Madhya Pradesh\nthat these malguzari lands could not be · regarded\nas estates within the meaning of article 31-A read\nwith the Tenancy Acts in force in Madhya Pradesh,\nbut he contended that, inasmuch as article 31-B pur-\nported to validate specifically the Madhya Pradesh\nAct among others, and as that article was not limited\nin its application to estates, the objection could not\nprevail. Article 39 of the Directive Principles of\nState Policy states as follows :--\n\"The State shall, in particular, direct its policy\nt!owards securing that the ownership and control of\nthe material resources of the community are so dis-\ntributed as best to subserve the common good ; and\nthat the operation of the economic system does not\nresult in the concentration of wealth and means of\nproduction to the common detriment.\" (1) Notwithstanding anything in the fore-\nSaving of laws going provisions of this Part, no law\nThe State of\nBihar pro~i.ding for ac- providing for the acquisition by the\nv. rqmsitton of estates, State of any estate or of any rights I\nMaharaia etc. This apart, if, as I\nhave endeavoured to show, payment of compensation\nisi not a justiciable issue in the case of the impugned\nstatutes, having regard to articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B,\nit is not open to the court to inquire whether a deduc-\ntion which results in reducing the compensation is un-\nwarranted and therefore, a fraud on the Constitution. In other words, it is not Maharaja\nnecessary to treat the obligation to pay compensation dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nas implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative\nSingh\nheads themselves, for it is separately and expressly\nof Darbhanga\nprovided for in article 31 (2). SUPREME COURT REPORTS 929\nand attached to it as an incident, an obligation to 1952\nmake compensation ; this latter, morally speaking,\nThe State of\nfollows the other indeed like a shadow but it is yet\nBihar\ndistinct from it, and flows from another source.\" That the vesting of the estates in the State of\nBihar under the Act being in effect an acquisition of\nthe estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not\nfor a public purpose and the provision for compen-\nsation was illusory. In any case we are\nBihar\nto consider whether arrears of rent are \"property\" in\nv.\n• the sense m which that expression ts used in our Maharaja\nConstitution and understood m our law. 44.940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952}\n1952 mean, must include a purpose, that is, an object or\naim, in which the general interest of the community as\nThe State af\nopposed to the particular interest of individuals 1s\nBihar\nv. directly and vitally concerned.

Raising funds910 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 for augmenting the Treasury could not be regard-\ned as a public purpose such as would justify expro-\nThe State of\npriation of private property. As regards section 23(f) the Bihar Land Reforms\nAct, my learned brother has based his decision on the\nground that the provision of this clause constitutes a\nfraud on the Constitution, and although in enacting\nthe provision, the legislature purported to exer-\ncise its powers under entry 42 of the Legisla-\nJo. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 993\nthat, apart from the absence of any such recital, 1952\nthere is no indication whatever as to the existence\nThe State of\nof any public purpose in any of the operative provi-\nBihar\nsions of the Act. The phrase \"public purpose\" has to he con-\nstrued according to the spirit of the times in which\nparticular legislation is enacted and so construed, the\nacquisition of the estates has to be held to have been\nmade for a public purpose. The third ...\nalternative position is that if the word \"acquisition\"\nin entry 36 in List II does not, by itself, imply the\nobligation to provide for compensation and if the\nwords. It was\nsaid that the Act, while pretending to comply with\nthe Constitution, evades and invades it ; that the Act\nmerely pretends to comply with the Constitution when\nit says that it provides for payment of compensation •\nbut in effect it has produced a scheme for non-payment\nof compensation by shift and contrivance. In a nutshell, it was contended v.\nthat the object of the Act was to acquire properties of Maharaja\nthe zemindars by payment of compensation (so-called) dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nout of the moneys belonging to the zemindars them-\nSingh\nselves and that in some cases they had not only to of Darbhanga\ngive up their estates for nothing but would have to and Others. The High· Court rejected the plea\nSingh\nof the State that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution by of Darbhanga\nreason of the words \"notwithstanding anything in and Others. Secondly, it was said that\nBihar\nv. these 'arrears' would represent so much money when\nMaharaja realised, and money could not be the subject of com-\ndhiraja Sir pulsory acquisition as the obligation to pay compensa-\nKameshwar\ntion would practically turn such acquisition into a\nSingh\nforced loan. Similar arguments may as well be founded on\narticle 31-A, for that article also protects a law from\narticle 31 (2) which is in Part III of the Constitution. According to him clause (2) assumed\nThe State of\nBihar but did not \"provide\" that acqms1t10n should be\nv. authorised only for a public purpose. Similarly, clall!se (5) (b ), which\nexcepts certain categories of \"laws\" from the opera-\ntion of clause (2), contemplates· laws being made with-\nout a public purpose or payment of compensation. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 923\nto the State under the provisions of section 11 and 1952\nthey are to be deemed to be leased by the State to the\nThe State of\nlessee with effect from the date of vesting. the acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the\nundesirable but inevitable consequences I have men-\ntioned The Bihar Legislature obviouslly thought\nthat the tenants in arears will have better treatment\nand a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter\nof the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the State\nwhich will act under the guidance of the Land Com-\nmission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole\nsurviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only\nbe to realise as much of the arrears as they can from\nthe tenants and within the shortest possible time\nwithout any mercy or accommodation. Is\nthere, then, any entry in List II under which a State\nLegislature can make a law for acquisition without\ncompensation or pub! The words do not mean that when a State makes a\nlaw under entry 36 it must lay down the principles on which\ncompensation payable for property acquired is to be determined\nand the form and manner in which it should be given. These two, therefore, have not the same origin ; they\ndo not come, for instance, from any implied watract\nbetween the State and the individual, that the former\nshall have the property, if it will make compensation ;\nthe right is no mere right to pre-emption, and it has •\nno condition of compensation annexed to it: either\nprecedent or subsequent ; but there is a right to take,\n(1) [19191 A.C. 744.S.C.R.

The answer that\ncomes to imy mind is that it is fraud because the Act\nprovides for compensation only on the baSiis of income\nand, therefore, properties which are at present\nnon-income-yielding but whii;h have very rich1004 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19521\n1952 potentialities are acquired without any compensation\nat all.

Reuben J.\nMnharaja observed as follows :-\ndhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\n\"From article 31, clause (2), it is clear that the\nSingh\nConstituent Assembly considered two requirements\nof Darbhanga\nand Others. On\nthe merger of those States in Madhya Pradesh or\nUttar Pradesh, as the case may be, by virtue of the\n\"covenant of merger\" entered into between the rulers\nand the Government of India the properties in question\nwere recognised to be the \"private property\" of the\nRulers. Mr. P. R. Das complains that the Legislature has\nshirked its responsibility and delegated this essential\n• legislative power to the State Government to be\nexercised under rules made by itself under its rule-\nmaking power under section 43 (2) (p). If\na principle has beeh laid down in the Act but that\nprinciple does not in fact produce any compensation\nin any rare case or adequate compensation in some\ncases then the real complaint should be, not that no\nprinciple has been laid down but, that the principle\nlaid down does not produce what may be called just\ncompensation. Article 31(4) is in these terms:-\n\"If any Bill pending at the commencement of\nthis Constitution in the legislature of a State has,\n.~\nafter it has been passed by such Legislature, been\n(1) (1880) 5 App. v.\nFrom very early times, law has recognized the right\nMaharaia\ndhiraja Sir of Government compulsorily to acquire private pro-\nKameshwar perties of individuals for a public purpose and this has\nSingh come to be known as the law of eminent domain.

Even then I would hold\nthat the same reasons, which have weighed with my\nlearned brother in declaring section 23(f) of the\nimpugned Act to be unconstitutional, apply with\nequal, if not greater, force to section 4 (b) of the Act\nand I have no hesitation in agreeing with him as\nregards his decision on the constitutionality of this\nprovision of the Act though I would prefer to adopt\na different line of reasoning in support of the same. Clause ( 4) of article 31 does not\ndo away with the obligation to pay compensation ; it\nmerely lays down that laws which are referred to in\nclause (3) of the article would be immune from judi-\ncial scrutiny on the ground of inadequacy of the\n(I) Vi de Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, Vol. Putting aside the later articles for the moment, it is\nplain that, under article 31 ( 4), the three impugned\nstatutes are protected from attack in any court on the\n• ground that they contravene the provisions of article\n31(2). But it has\nno application to laws authorising acquisition of other\nkinds of property and, as regards these, the require-\nments as to public purpose and payment of compen-\nsation are still enforced by the express provisions of\narticle 31(2). It is urged by Mr. P. R. Das\nthat entry 42 in List III really implements the obli-\ngation implicit in entry 36 in List II and the two\nentries are complementary to each other. On the same day, a\n•\nnotification under section 3 of the Act was published\nstating that the estates and tenures belonging to the\nrespondent and two others passed to and became\nvested in th~ State of Bihar under the provisions of\nthe Act. a law for compulsory\nacquisition of private property, to provide for com-\npensation and either to fix the amount thereof or\nspecify the principles on which and the manner in\nwhich the compensation is to be determined and given\nis the provision of art'icle 31 (2). I would, therefore, hold that there is a public pur-\npose for the impugned Act within the meaning of\nclause (2) of article 31.\" It is urged that the Bihar Legislature having\npurported to exercise its power to make a law for\ncompulsory acquisition of property under entry 36 m\n( 1) L.R. The\nmatters comprised in entry 42 in List III, as a legisla-\ntive head, are the principles for the determination of\ncompensation and the form and manner of giv'ing\n,\nthe compensation for property which is described\nas having been acquired· or requisitioned for\nthe stated purposes. List II is restricted, that is to say, that the subject-\nmatter of entry 42 in List III is not within the content\nof entry 36 in List II. The first important question is\nwhether this obligati'on is implicit in the term \"acquisi-\ntion\" as used in entry 36 in List II, or in other words\nwhether this obligation is to be inferred simply from\nthe nse of that term as a part of the content or mean-\ning thereof. Therefore, the arguments of Mr. P. R.\nDas founded on entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in\nList III cannot be rejected in limine but have to be\nconsidered and I proceed to do so immediately. 747.1006 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952\nwere to deal with this matter according to my own\nnotions, I would have dismissed this argument in\nThe State of\nlimine, for here the Legii>lature has not abdicated or\nBihar\nv. effaced itself in the sense I have explained in my\nMaharaja· opinion in that case. For any statement\nKameshwar\nthat the payment of compensation is a primary condi-\nSingh\nof Darbhanga tion for acquisition of property for a public purpose,\nand Others. able position that entry 42 of its own force implies\nan obligation to pay compensation, as he could not\notberwi:;e jump over the hurdles created in his way by ·\nsub-sections (3) and (4) of article 31 and the new\narticles 31-A and 31-B. But he maintained that\na constitutional prohibition against compulsory acqui-\nsition of property without public necessity and pay-\nment of compensation was deducible from what he-\ncalled the \"spirit of the Constitution\", which, accord-\ning to him, was a valid test for judging the constitutio-\nnality of a statute. The crucial point for determination in these appeals\nh to discover the extent to which article 31 ( 4) of\nthe Constitution or the new articles 31-A and 31-B\nhave deprived the expropriated proprietor of his\nrights or remedies in respect of this matter and of the\n'\nguaranteed right to get compensation for property\nacquired. It is not disputed that as a\nv.\nresult of this enactment a very large sum of money Maharaja\nnow payable by the tenants as and by way of current dhiraja Sir ·\nKame sh war\nrent and arrears of rent to their respective landlords\nSingh\nwill be intercepted by the State but it is urged, on the of Darbhanga\nauthority of certain passages in Cooley's Constitu- and Others. In Westminster v •\nCorporation v.

Under the Constitution, when property is requisition-\ned or acquired, it may be for a Union purpose or a\nState purpose, or for any · other public purpose. compensation provided in the Act, if he was not\nable to convince the Court on his main point that he\n•\ncould challenge the offending Act on grounds other\nthan those mentioned in Part III of the Constitution,\nand that there was something in entries No. What article 31 ( 4) really\nsays is that the contravention of the express\nprovisions of article 31 (2) relating to payment of J\ncompensation will not be a justiciable issue. Such arrears could dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\nnot vest in the State as a normal result of acquisition\nSingh\nof any estate or interest therein, and it is of Darbhanga·\ncon..:cdcd by the learned Attorney-General that article and Others. Tha.t they\ncannot bear the interpretation sought to • be put upon\nthem by Mr. Das is clear from the fact that similar\nwords do not occur in entry 33 of List I which confers\non Parliament the power of making laws with respect\nto acquisition or requisitioning of property for the\npurposes of the Union. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents\naccept the position that as a result of the con-\nstitutional amendments tl1e impugned Act has\nbeen removed from the operation of the provisions\nof Part III of the Constitution including article 14\nand that the respondents cannot, therefore, complain\nof the breach of the equal protection of the laws under\narcicle 14 which was the only ground on which the\nrespondents succeeded in the High Court. and, therefore, the alleged requirement of a public\npurpose under entry 42 in List III cannot be said to\nbe incorporated in entry 33 in List I. Further, the moment\neven this regulated freedom of the individual becomes\nincompatible wi,th and threatens the freedom of the\ncommunity the State is given power by article 21, to\n<leprive the individual of his life and personal liberty\n•\nin accordance with procedure established by law,\nsubject, of course, to the provisions of article 22. Co. v. Evans (') :- '\n\"The Legislature cannot fairly be supposed to in-\ntend, in the absence of clear words showing such\nintention, that one man's property shall be confiscated\nfor the benefit of others, or of the public, without any\n(1) [1920] A.C. p. 508. To appreciate the contentions raised by Mr. Das on\nthe question of the competence of the Bihar Legisla-\nture to enact the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, it is\n•\nnecessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what\nsubjects the legislature has purported to enact the\nlaw. If, then, these two\ngrounds of attack fall within the purview of article\n31 ( 4), the words \"notwithstanding anything m this\nConstitution\" are apt to exclude such grounds how-\nsoever they are derived-whether from the entries in\nthe legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-\ntion-for both alike are covered by those words. Reference in this connection was\nmade to the decision in Hamabai Pramjee Petit v.\nSecretary of State for India (1), where it was observed\n:that the phrase \"public purpose\" whatever it . It did not leave the matter to\nMaharafa· be discovered and spelt out by learned arguments at\ndhiraja Sir the Bar from out of the contents of entry 36 ; they\nKameshwar\nexplicitly provided for it in article 31 (2) of the\nSingh\nConstitution. 31 (2) but is a\nrequirement of entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in\nList III. The Act 1s intituled\nSingh\n\"The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950\". ;;,; may b~ without giving his assent under\nPatanjali article 200, the statutes did not satisfy the require- ,\nSastri C. f,\nments of article 31 (3) and so could not have \"effect\". Secondly, what\narticles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B exclude is a challenge to\nthe Act on the ground of contravention of the \"pro-\nvision\" of clause (2). The term \"legislature\" is not\nalways used in the Constitution as including the\nGovernor, though article 168 mak.es him a component\npart of the State Legislature. -0f the Government without any benefit being derived\nby the tenants ; that private property could not be\nacquired for merely augmenting the revenues of the\nState; and that the only purpose that could be gather-\n·ed from this Act was the ruination of a large class of\npersons without any corresponding benefit to any sec-\ntion of the community. In my opinion, the Bihar Land\nReforms Act of 1950 is not unconstitutional, with the\nexception of the provisions contained in section 4(b)\nand 23(f) of the Act and these provisions alone must\nbe held to be void and inoperative. It is true that under the common law of eminent\ndomain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civi-\nlized countries, the State cannot take the property of\nits subject unless such property is required for a public\npurpose and without compensating the owner for its\nloss. Public purpose is an essential ingredient in the very\ndefinition of the expression \"eminent domain\" as\ngiven by Nichols and other constitutional writers, even\nthough obligation to pay compensation is not a content\nof the definition but has been added to it by judicial\ninterpretation. A more liberal and\nmore flexible meaning makes it synonymous with\n\"public advantage\", \"public benefit\". The\nconstitutionality of these Acts having been challenged\nin the respective State High Courts on nrious grounds,\nthe Bihar Act was declared unconstitutional and void\non the ground that it contravened article 14 of the\nConstitution, the other grounds of attack being reject-\ned while the other two Acts were adjudged constitu-\ntional and valid. forward on behalf of the respondents is that the neces-\nsity for the existence of a public purpose as a condi-\ntion precedent to compulsory acquisition of private\nproperty is not a \"provision\" 0£ articl\\! The learned Attorney-General contended in dealing\nwith entry 42 that legislation under entry 42 can also\nlay down principles that would lead to the non-pay-.•\nment of any compensation and he cited Atiqa\nBegum's case(') as an authority in his support. Entry 36 covers any Maharaja\ndhiraja Sir\npurpose except the purpose of the Union and is not,\nKameshwar\nin terms, limited to public purpose. That the subject-matter of the Act fell under\narticle 31 ( 4) of the Constitution.918 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 5. Article 31 (I) of our Constitution provides \"No per-\nson shall be deprived of his property save by autho-\nrity of law\". The explanation attached to the\nclause further provides that for purposes of the\nclause the expre\"ion \"arrears of rent\" shall include\narrears in respect of which suits were pending\non the date of vesting or in respect of which\ndecrees were obtained before that date together with\ncosts allowed by such decrees. 31(2)\nand though the courts cannot examine the extent or adequacy\n-0f the provisions of compensation contained in any law dealing\nwith the acquisition of property compulsorily, yet the provisions\nof art.

The right to legislate under entry 36\npostulates the existence of a public purpose and the\ncontention is that there was no public purpose behind\nthe Act.

It may be that\nsome of the provisions of the Act may operate harshly\non certain persons or a few of the zamindars and may\nbe bad if they are in excess of the legislative power\nof the Bihar Legislature but from that circumstance\nit does not follow that the whole enactment is a fraud\non the Constitution. Though the\nmain object of the Act, viz., the acquisition of estates, is for a\npublic purpose, the acquisition of arrears of rent due to the\nzamindars on payment of 50 per cent. 89.896 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 or of a State or for any other public purpose is to be\ndetermined, and the form and the manner . He appear-\ned to concede what Mr. Das so strenuously contested,\nthat those entries, concerned as they were with the\n•\ngrant of power to the State Legislature to legislate\nwith respect to matters specified therein, could not be\ntaken, as a matter of construction, to import an obli--\ngation to pay compensation. )-Thc Bihar Land Reforms Act, XXX of\nThe State of 1950, is not unconstitutional or void except with regard to the\nBihar provisions in s. 4(b) and s. 23(f) thereof. It is true that the\n\"Legislature\" of a State includes the Governor\nand that a bill passed by such Legislature\ncannot become a law until it receives the Gover-\nnor's assent. The clause\nis m effect an independent provision laying down\nthat monies due to the proprietor or tenure-holder\nduring the period antecedent to the vesting and\nnot realized by him but which were in the course of\nrealization, whether by private effort or by means of\npending suit~ or decree~ including the costs of those922 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952\nsuits and decrees will stand forfeited to the State. If, therefore, the State\nis to give effect to these avowed purposes of our Con-\nstitution we must regard as a public purpose all that\nwill be calculated to promote the welfare of the people\nas envisaged in these directive principles of State\npolicy whatever else that expression may mean. If it was intended that Maharaja\ndhiraja Sir\nsuch a law should have the assent of both the Governor\nKameshwar\nand the President, one would expect to find not only\nSingh\na more clear or explicit provision to that effect, but\nof Darbhang11\nalso some reference in article 200 to the Governor's and· Others. It is a recognised rule for the con-\nstruction of statutes that, unless the words of the\nstatute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be con-\n•\nstrued ·s o as to take away the property of a subject\nwithout compensation : Attorney-General v. De\nKeyser's Royal Hotel(1 The power to take compulsorily\n). The Constitu-\ndhiraja Sir\ntion would thus seem to contemplate only \"bills\"\nKameshwar\nSingh passed by the House or Houses of Legislature being\nof Darbhanga reserved for the consideration of the President and not\nand Others. It is futile to attempt to get over\nthis anomaly by suggesting that clauses ( 4) and (5) (b)\n(ii) of article 31 have been inserted in the Constitution\nex abundanti cautela, for, if Mr. P. R. Das were correct\nin his submission, no amount of caution was necessary\nfor protecting a law that, ex hypothesi, cannot be made\nat all. It will be noticed that the argument that the .Act\nis unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that\nit has not laid down any principle for determining\ncompensation as required by entry 42 in List III and\nthat the provision for compensation is wholly illusory. In998 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]\n1952 the light of this new outlook what, I ask, is the pur- .,\n-,\npose of the State in adopting measure~ for the acquisi-\nThe State· of\ntion of the zamindaries and the interests of the inter-\nBihar\nv. mediaries ? This purpose does not fall within\nany definition, however wide, of the phrase \"public\npurpose\" and the law therefore to this extent is un-\nconstitutional. Atiqa Begum and Others('), Thakur /agannath\nBaksh Singh v. The United Provinces(2) and Megh Raj\n-and Another v. Allah Rakhia and Others(8) in support\nof the proposition that each entry in the list, which is\na category or head of the subject-matter of legislation,\nmust be construed as widely as possible so as to in-\nclude all ancillary matters. · v.\nobserved that to take one man's property compulsorily Maharajit-\nfor giving it away to another in discharge of Govern- dhiraja Sir\nment's obligations is not a legitimate and permissible Kameshwar\nSingh\nexercise of the power of acquisition. The arrears of rent, Mukhtriea f.\ntherefore, are the subject-matter of separate and indi-\npendent acquisition i1nrler the Rih:i.r I,,~nd Reforms\nAct, if the word \"acquisition\" can at a11 be appropriate\nto cases of this description. with respect to the principles on which compensa-\nPatanjali tiop for property acquired was to be determined\nSastri C. /, and the form and the mauner m wji.ich such\ncompensation was to be given, it was not com-\npetent for the Bihar Legislature to delegate this essen-\ntial legislative power to the executive government. It has been suggested\nin course of the argument on behalf of the State that\nin the present case the Government in the exercise of\nits powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears of\nrent and as the arrears were still unrealised, it was\nquite legitimate and proper for the Government to\ndeduct half of the gross amount as consideration for\nthe trouble and expense that it would have to undergo\nin the matter of realising these arrears. This\nvery Bihar Act was before the Constituent Assembly\nwhen it passed article 31 ( 4) and again when it took\nthe trouble of amending the Constitution for saving\nthis very Act. The existence of a public purpose is not a pro-\nVlSlOn or condition imposed by article 31 (2) as a\nlimitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition. It has also been shown that at least in one case, dhiraja Sir\nKameshwar\ne.g., iu the case of the Raja of Purnea the compensation Singh\ncalculated according to the principle laid down in the of Darbhanga\nAct works out at a deficit figure. Maharaja\ndhiraja Sir\nA new Schedule called the Ninth Schedule specifying\nKameshwar\nthirteen several Acts and Regulations of which the Singh\nBihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, was the first was of Darbhanga\nadded to the Constitution. It will be recalled\nthat the High Court of Patna held the Bihar Act un-\nconstitutional as being discriminatory in providing for\npayment of compensation, and it was to overcome\nthat difficulty that articles 31-A and 31-B were\ninserted in the Constitution. Willis say!l in his Constitu-\ntional Law at page 816:-\"While, as stated above,\nany and all property is in general subject to the exer-\ncise of the power of eminent domain, there are certain\nrather unusual forms of private property which can-\nnot thus be taken. But it is difficult\nBihar •\nv. to imagine that there can be any principles fur non-\nMaharaja payment of compensation or for negativing the pay-\ndhiraja Sir ment of compensation. Thus in section 31\n(XXXI) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitu-\ntion Act the acquisition of property on just terms has\nbeen made a head or category of legislative power of\nthe Commonwealth Parliament. This\nargument really has no force, because the provisions\nas to a~sessment of compensation enacted in the Land\nAcquisition Act only apply to acquisitions that are\nmade by notification under that Act. The learned Judges of the High Court\nnegatived this conten.tion on the ground that the ques-\ntion whether there was a public purpose in support of\nthe acquisition of the estates had been by implication\ndecided by the Constituent Assembly and therefore\nthe Court could not go into this matter. It will be noted, however, that articles 31-A and\n31-B afford only limited protection against one ground\nof challenge, namely that the law in question is \"in-\nconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the\nrights conferred by any provisions of this Part\".

  "summary": "The main submission on behalf of the appellant was\ndirected towards establishing that the entire proceed:\nings before the Additional District Magistrate and the\ntrying Magistrate were without jurisdiction as cogniz\nance of the offence had been taken on September 16,\n1952, in contravention of the provisions of s. 23(3) of\nthe ]foreign Exchange Regulation Act, there being on\nthat date no complaint in writing made by an officer\nauthorised in that behalf by the Central Government\nor the Reserve Bank of India by a general or a special\norder. On September 11, 1952, the\nReserve Bank of India authorized Inspector S. B.\nMitra of the Special Police Establishment, Calcutta, to\nmake a representation to the Additional District\nMagistrate, 24 Parganas (hereinafter referred to as the\nAddtiona1 District Magistrate) for permission to\nproceed against the appellant as required under\ns. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. In the present case, as the\nrequisite authority had been granted by the Reserve\nBank on January 27, 1953, to file a complaint, the\ncomplaint filed on February 2, was one which complied\nwith the provisions of s. 23 of the ]foreign Exchange\nRegulation Act and the Additional District Magistrate\ncould take cognizance of the offence which, indeed, he\ndid on that date. The Additional I959\nDistrict Magistrate thereon recorded the following order:\nNarayandas\n\"Seen the complaint filed to day against the\nBhagwandas\naccused Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas under Madhavdas\nsection 8(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act v.\nread with Section 23B thereof read with Section 19 of The State of\nWest Bengal\nthe Sea Customs Act and Notification No. The orders passed by the Additional I959\nDistrict Magistrate on September 16, 1952, Se~tember\nNarayandas\n19, 1952, November 19, 1952, and January 2, 1953,\nBhagwandas\nwere orders passed while the investigation by the\nMadhavdas\npolice into a non-cognizable offence was in progress. There was no legal\nbar to the Additional District Magistrate taking cogniz\nance of the offence on February 2, 1953, as on that\ndate Inspector Mitra's complaint was one which he\nwas authorized to make by the Reserve Bank under\ns. 23(3)(b) of the Foreign •Exchange Regulation Act. Since, Narayandas\nBhagwandas\nhowever, the authorization required under s. 23(3)\nJY!adltavda<\nof the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (VII of 1947) v.\nwas not obtained till January 27, 1953, the cognizance The State of\ntaken by the Magistrate on September 16, 1952, was West Bengal\nwithout jurisdiction. On September II, 1952, the Reserve Bank\nauthorised Inspector Mitra to move the Additional District\nMagistrate, 24 Parganas under s. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange\nRegulation Act, for permission to proceed against the appellant. Under s. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange\nRegulation Act a District Magistrate or Magistrate of\nthe first class may, on a representation in writing m.ade\nby a person authorized in this behalf by the Central\nGovernment or the Reserve Bank and having reasons\nto believe that there had been contravention of any of\nthe provisions of that Act, issue a search warrant. It is true that the High Court has taken\nMadhavdas\na different view to that taken by the trying Magistrate\nv.\nThe Stale of and has rejected the appellant's case that he had vol\nWest Bengal untarily handed over the currency notes in question to\nthe Customs Officers in the circumstances mentioned\nImam]. It\nfound, on the evidence of the Superintendent of the\nReserve Bank, that the Reserve Bank received no\napplication from the appellant before September 7,\n1952, nor had the Reserve Bank granted the permission\nto the appellant to take any currency notes out of India. If, on the other hand, after completing the investig\nation a complaint was filed, as in this case, it would be\nthe duty of the Additional District Magistrate then to\nenquire whether the complaint had been filed with the\nrequisite authority of the Reserve Bank as required by\ns. 23(3)(b) of the ]'oreign Exchange Regulation Act. It is clear from these orders that on September 19,\n1952, the Additional District Magistrate had not taken\ncognizance of the offence because he had allowed the\npolice time till November 19, 1952, for completing the\ninvestigation. The agpellant contended\nthat the entire trial was without jurisdiction as the Magistrate\nhad taken cognizance of the offence on September 16, 1952,\nwithout there being a complaint in writing by a person autho\nrised as required by s. 23(3) of the Act. It could not be\nsaid with any good reason that the Additional District\nMagistrate had either on September 16, or at any sub\nsequent date upto February 2, 1953, applied his ·mind to\nthe case with a view to issuing a process against the\nappellant. v. February 2, 1953, the Additional District Magistrate applied his\nTJie State of mind to the case \\vith a vie\\\\' to issuing a process and sent the\nJVest lJ1J1;gal case for trial to another magistrate. 'M adhavdas\nwas issued by the Additional District Magistrate and\nv.\nThe State of appellant was thereafter :irrested and released on bail\nWest ·ncng{il with a direction to a ppcnr before the Additional Dis\ntrict Magistrate on Septmnber 19. The main submission made on hehalf of the\nappellant before 11s has been that the Additional\nl>istric:t Magistrate Jrnving taken congnizance of the\noffonee on l'cpt.em her Hl, 1952, and as the provisions of\ns. 23(:l) of the For<,ign Exc:hange Regulation Act had\nnot hcmn <:ompliccl with, the Pntire proceedings before\nhim an cl I he i\\lagistrafo who tried the case were wit.bout\njurisclietion. It was also urged that the facts found\nBhagwandas\ndid not attract the provisions of s. 19 of the Sea Cus\nMadhavdas\ntoms Act (8 of 1878) as it could not be said that at the v.\nmoment the appellant was searched by the Customs The State of\nOfficials, he was taking out of India across any customs West Bengal\nfrontier as defined by the Central Government the cur\nImam]. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 99\nconnection on September 15 and 16, 1952, Inspector r959\nMitra of the Special Police Establishment, Calcutta\nNarayandas\nhad applied for a search warrant and a warrant i;if ar\nBhagwandas\nrest respectively against the appellant. Mitra thereupon applied to the Additional District,\nMagistrate on September 16, 1952, for a search warrant96 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\nI959 to be issued which was allowed. It seems to me clear however\nBhagwandas\nthat before it can be said that any magistrate has taken\nMadhavdas\ncognizance of any offence under section 190(l}(a)\nv.\nThe State of_ Criminal Procedure Code, he must not only have\nWest Bengal applied his mind to the contents of the petition but\n' muRt have done so for the purpose of proceeding in a\nImam]. On :U'ehruary 2, 1953, a complaint was filed\nagainst the appellant charging him with an offence\nnnder s. 8(2) of the :Foreign Exchange Hegulation Act\nreal'.l with s. 19 of the Sea ( \\1stoms Act and Notification\nNo. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 95\nMagistrate issued the warrant of arrest against the I959\nappellant he could not have done so without having\npreviously taken congnizance of the offence. It was urged that the appeal is before us on a certific\nate apd as the High Conrt had come to a different\nI~98 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\n'959 fiinding on a question of fact to what the trying Magi\nstrate had found, it was open to the appellant to urge\nNarayandas that he was entitled to question the findings of the\nBhagwandas\nHigh Court. On September 19, the Magistrate granted bail to the appellant\nbut refused him exemption from personal attendance before the\nCourt and granted time· till November 19, 1952, for completing\nthe investigation. On September 19, 1952, the appellant appeared\nbefore the Additional District Magistrate who recorded\nthe following order :-\n\" He is to give bail of Rs. Inspector Mitra was so authorized by the Reserve Bank\ntm September 11, 1952, and in pursuance of that\nauthorization applied to the Additional District\nMagistrate for the issue of a ·search warrant. The complaint was filed on\nFebruary 2, 1953, before the Additional District Magistrate who\ntransferred the case to a Magistrate I Class for trial. It does seem extraordinary that if\nthe appellant had sent the application to Joshi on\nSeptember 2, 1952, that Joshi should not have sent on\nthat application to the Reserve Bank till September 15,\n1952. It is clear, therefore,\nthat upto September 16, 1952, the Additional District\nMagistrate had not taken cognizance of any offence. On that date the complaint was filed and the\norder of the Additional District Magistrate clearly\nindicated that he took cognizance of the offence and\nsent the case for trial to Mr. Sinha. In order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary\nfor him to arrest the appellant and that he could not\ndo without a warrant of arrest from the Additional\nDistrict Magistrate. It was, however, argued that\nwhen Mitra applied for a search warrant on Septem\nber, 16, 1952, the Additional District Magistrate had\nrecorded an order thereon, \" Permitted. Obviously, it is only when a\nMagistrate applies his mind for the purpose of proceed\ning under s. 200 ~nd subsequent sections of Chapter\nXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under s. 204\nof Chapter XVII of the Code that it can be positively\nstated that he had applied his mind and therefore had\ntaken cognizance. the offence was taken by the\nAdditional District Magistrate on February 2, 1953, after the\ncomplaint had been filed and the trial was valid. It was also urged that explana\ntion offered by the appellant was accepted by the\ntrying Magistrate and the High Court ought not to\nhave set aside the acquittal of the appellant, there\nbeing no good ground why his explanation should not\nhave been accepted. An important circumstance which might\nhave supported the appellant's case, namely whether\nhe had applied to the Reserve Bank of India for a per\nmit to take out of India currency notes to the extent\nof Rs. In our opinion, the proceedings before the Additional\nDistrict Magistrate and the trying Magistrate were\nwith jurisdiction and the trial of the appellant was\nlegal. On November 19, 1952, on perusal of the police\nreport the Magistrate allowed further time for investiga\ntion until January 2, 1953, and on that date time was\nfurther extended to February 2, 1953. The order of the Additional District Magistrate\ndirecting the issue of a search warrant and the word\n\" permitted \" contained t,herein we consider, in the\ncontext of the application, to mean that he granted\nthe sanction for investigation as asked for. his executing a bond with or without sureties to\nappear if and when so required before the Additional\nDistrict Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of\nthe offence on a police report and to try the accused or\ncommit him for trial. As already stated, the order of\nthe Additional District Magistrate of September 19,\n1952, makes it quite clear that he was still regarding\nthe matter as one under investigation. Under\ns. 155(3) of the Code a police officer being permitted to\ninvestigate a non-cognizable offence may exercise the\nsame powers in respect of the investigation as an officer\nincharge of a police station may exercise in a cogniz\nable case, e}\\,cept that he has not the power to arrest\nwithout a warrant. On September 16, 1952, Mitra applied to the Magistrate for a\nsearch warrant and for a warrant of arrest and both warrants\nwere issued. The Additional\nDistrict Magistrate, however, must be regarded as\nhaving taken cognizance on this date because he sent\nthe case to Mr. Sinha for trial.

We\ncannot accept the submission made on behalf of the\nappellant that the charge to the jury is vitiated\nbecause of the decision of this Court in Sarwa.n Singh's\ncase.132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\nI959 ' As to the second submission made by Mr. Umrigar\nit is to be remembered that in Baskerville's case the\nJ nanendra Nath Court of Criminal Appeal in England after discussing\nGhose\nvarious authorities on the subject came to the follow\nv.\ning conclusion :-\nThe Slate of\n\" We hold that evidence in corroboration must be\nWest Ben.gal\nindependent testimony which affects the accused by\nImam]. Indeed, the Sessions Judge went to the length of\ntelling the jury that although an approver's evidence\nis strictly admissible and a conviction is not illegal\nmerely because it is based on an approver's evidence,\nit was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person\non such evidence except under very rare and excep\ntional circumstances and usually substantial cor\nroboratLm was required. Apart from the question of corrobora\ntion of the approver's evidence nothing was suggested\nto us or to the High Court in what respect the\napprover's evidence was unreliable after testing his\nevidence in the same way as one would test the evid\nence of any witness for the prosecution in a criminal\ncase. -\nIn the present case the jury had been clearly directed\nby the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence\nmust be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e.,\nwhich confirms in some material particulars not only\nthe evidence that the crime had been committed but\nalso that the appellant had committed it. It would be\nin high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate\nthe kind of evidence which would be regarded as\ncorroboration, except to say that corroborative\nevidence is evidence which shows or tends to show\nthat the story of the accomplice that the accused\ncommitted the crime is true, not merely that the\ncrime has been committed, but that it was commit\nted by the accused.\n\" Reliance was placed\n]nanendra·Nath\nGhose\non the case of The King v. Baskerville (1), (3) that the\ncircumstantial evidence corroborating the approver\nv.\nThe State of was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the\nWest Bengal murder of the deceased and (4) that on similar corrobor\nation of the approver's testimony the accused J agdish\nImam]. 953, that the approver's\nevidence had to satisfy a double test i.e., he must be a reliable\nwitness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and\nin that the corroborating evidence was not sufficient to connect\nthe appellant with the crime. This Court went on to observe, \" The\nargument that the character of the approver's evid\nence has not been considered by the High Court\ncannot be characterised as merely academic or theo\nretical in the present case because, as we shall presently\npoint out, the evidence of the approver is so thoroughly\ndiscrepant that it would be difficult to resist the\nconclusion that the approver in the present case is a\nwholly unreliable witness. The\nWest Bengal\nSessions Judge in dealing with the evidence of the\nltna111 j. approver charged the jury as follows :-\n\" Before doing so, some established legal principles\nas regards the approver's evidence and the confes\nsions on which the prosecution has relied in the\npresent case are required to be explained to you. The Sessions Judge had correctly directed the jury that the\ncorroboration of the evidence of the approver in material parti\nculars must relate not only to the commission of the crime, but\nalso to the evidence connecting or tending to connect the accused\nwith the crin1e. Jnanmdra Nath\nAs to the 4th submission that although there was\nGhose\nv. similar corroboration of the approver's evidence\nThe State of against J agdish Gorain but he had been acquitted by\nWest Bengal the jury although no real distinction between his case\nand the case of the appellant arose is unsound as, in\nImam]. Indeed it may be legitimate\nto point out that the learned Judges of the High Court\nhave themselves criticised the evidence of the approver\nin dealing with the prosecution case against Gurdial\nSingh and have ultimately found that the account\ngiven by the approver is unreliable and, though there\nwas circumstantial evidence which raised an amount\nof suspicion against Gurdial Singh, that would not be\nenough to sustain his conviction. Once there was evidence of such circumstances it was for the jury\nto decide whether they were sufficient corroboration of the\napprover's evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased. It is this corroborative evidence which deter\nmines the _mind of the Court or a jury that the\napprover's evidence that the accused committed the\ncrime is true. Nothing has been shown\nto us in this case, as was shown in Sarwan Singh's\ncase that apart from the approver's testimony in the\npresent case being regarded as tainted evidence his\nevidence as it stood was in any way unreliable. The conviction of the appellant depended on the\nevidence of the approver and the circumstantial\nevidence which corroborated him in connecting or\ntending or connect the appellant with the murder of\nthe deceased Sibapada Hati. It must show that he is a reliable witness and\nthat his evidence receives sufficient corroboration, (2)\nthat the evidence of an approver must be confirmed\nnot only as to the circumstances of the crime but also\nas to the identity of the prisoner. It is, however, urged\n] nantndra N allt\nby Mr. Umrigar that the circumstances mentioned\nGhose\nwere not circumstances corroborating the evidence of\nv.\nthe approver in material particulars which would The State of\nconnect or tend to connect the appellant with the West Bengal\ncrime. It would\nseem that on the approver's evidence the jury may\nwell have regarded the circumstances as insufficient\ncorroboration to connect or tending to connect J agdish\nGorain with the crime. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 133\nevidence, you should bear in mind, is evidence which I959\nshows or tends to show t\"hat the story of the accomplice\nJ nanendra Nath\nthat the accused committed the crime is true. Chose\nIn other words, it must be evidence which implicates v.\nhim, that is, which conforms in some material parti The State of\nculars not only the evidence that the crime has been West Bengal\ncommitted but also that the prisoner (accused)\nImsm],\ncommitted it. The jury should have been\ntold (1) in accordance with the decision of this Court\nin the case of Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab (1)\nthat the approver's evidence has to satisfy a double\ntest. As already\nstated, however, the approver's evidence is the direct\n· evidence which establishes that the appellant had\nmurdered the deceased. Indeed, the High Court was of the opinion that these\ncircumstances independent of the direct evidence of\nthe approver would not be sufficient to induce any\nreasonable person to come to the conclusion that the\nappellant had committed the crime. There should be corroboration in material\nparticulars not only concerning the crime but corrobor\nation of the approver's story by evidence whi9h\nconnects or tends to connect an accused with the\ncrime. Corrobora\ntion must be as to the crime and the identity of\neach one of the accused and the corroboration requir\ned must be independent evidence, that is reliable\nevidence of another kind.S.O.R. As to the 3rd submission made on behalf of the\nappellant the following circumstances were established\nby the evidence which were accepted by the jury :\nL There was a motive for the appellant to\ncommit the crime, that is to say, his immoral\nproposal to Lila, wife of the deceased. There can, no doubt be\na legal conviction upon the uncorroborated evi\ndence of an accomplice and, as already stated,\nthe uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is\nstrictly admissible and a conviction based on it alone\nis not illegal, yet you should remember, gentlemen,\nthat experience teaches us that an accomplice being\nalways an infamous person, he having thrown to the\nwolves his associates and friends in order to save his\nown skin and, though criminal, has purchased his\nliberty by betrayal, his evidence must be received\nwith very great caution and it is highly dangerous\nto act upon his evidence unless it is materially\ncorroborated. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 129\nEvidence in corroboration must be independent I959\ntestimony, which affects the accused by connecting\n] nanendra N alll\nor tending to connect the accused with the crime. It is true that in Sarwan Singh's case this Court had\nheld, \"The appreciation of an approver's evidence\nhas to satisfy a double test. The moment there is corroborative evidence which\nconnects or tends to connect an accused with the crime\nsuch corroborative evidence relates to the identity of\nthe accused· in connection with that crime."

The High Court, thereupon, made an order\non April 30, 1956, refusing leave to the Liquidators to\nprefer an appeal from the said Award, It was in\nthose circumstances that the appellants, namely,\nMessrs.

This award led to two appeals, one by the company\non the question of benefits arising from the service\nrendered under Messrs. M. M. Ispahani Ltd., and the\nother by the workmen with respect to puja bonus for\nthe year 1953. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. used to pay puja bonus\nto the workmen at the rate of one month's wages and the appellant\nalso paid the same from 1948 up to 1952, even in the years in\nwhich the appellant suffered losses. As to the quantum of bonus it r959\nwas laid down that even if payment was not at a Ispahani Ltd.,\nuniform rate throughout the period, the implied agree- Calcutta\nment to pay something could be inferred and it would v.\nbe for the tribunal to decide what was the reasonable Ispahani\namount to be paid as puja bonus.

  "summary": "In Messrs. Basa Musa\nSugar Works (Private) Ltd. v. Shobrati Khan (1 we had\n),\noccasion to point out that even where the employer\ndid not hold an enquiry before applying under s. 33 of\nthe Act for permission to dismiss an employee, he\ncould make good the defect by producing all relevant\nevidence which would hare been examined at the -\nenquiry, before the tribunal, in which case the tribunal\nwould consider the evidence and decide whether per\nmission should be granted or not. In another\ncase New Prakf:tsh Transport Co. Ltd. v. New S'uwarna\nTransport Co. Ltd. (\"), this Court held that \" rule;; of\nnatural justice vary \\vith the varying con;;titutions of\nstatutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the legis\nlature under which they have to act, and the ques\ntion whether in a particular case they have been\ncontravened must be judged not by any preconceiv\ned notion of what they may be but in the light of\nthe provisions of the relevant Act\". Held, that the question whether the Tribunal was a compe\ntent one under s. 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, prior to\nthe amending Act 36 of 1956, must be raised before the Tribunal\nitself as it was a matter of investigation and could not be raised\nfor the first time before the Supreme Court. This Court, speaking through\nVenkatarama Ayyar J. observed as follows in that\nconnection at p. 507 :-\n\" Stating it broadly and without intending it to\nbe exhaustive, it mav be observed that rules of natu\nral justice require th.~t a party should have the oppor\ntunity •>f a<ldueing all relevant evidence on which he\nrelies, that the evidence of the opponent should bC'\ntaken in his presence, and tha.t he should be given the\nopportunity of cro::;s,examining the witnesses exa.min\ned by that party, and that no materials should be\nrelied on agairnit him without his being given an\nopportunity of explaining them.\" SUPREME COURT REPORTS 35\nTwo points have been urged before us on behalf of\nz959\nthe company, namely- Ph lb · T E\n(1) t h e T r1' b u nal was not a competent t r1' b unal u an ea s1 a 1 e\nv.\nunder s. 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. copies of the statements of witnesses who had given\nevidence against Das were supplied to him or even\nthat the statements made by the witnesses to the\nmanager were read out, in extenso to Das before he\nwas asked to question them. At the relevant time, therefore, s. 7\nof the Act, which provided the qualifications of a\ntribunal, required that where it was one member tri\nbunal, he (a) should be or should have been a Judge\nof a High Court, or (b) should be or should have been\na district judge, or (c) should be qualified for appoint\nment as a Judge of a High Court. The Tribunal gave two reasons for holding that\nthe dismissal was unjustified; namely-(1) that36 SUPREME COURT ltEPORTS [1960(1))\nproper procedure had not been followed, and (2) that\nz959 -\nPh Iba -:--T E legal evidence was wanting. A reference was made by\nthe Government of Assam on March 8, 1956, to the\nIndustrial Tribunal on the question whether the dis-\n- missal of Das was justified; and if not, whether he\nwas entitled to reinstatement with or without com-\npensation or any other relief in lieu thereof. They show that when the enquiry was held\non March 12, certain persons, whose statements\nhad been recorded by the manager in the absence of\nDas during the course of what may be called investi\ngation by the company were present. The\ncharge against him was that on the night of February\n6/7, 1955, he along with one Samson, also an employee\nof the company, committed theft of two wheels com-\nplete with tyres and tubes from the company's lorry,\n534 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\n'959 which amounted to gross misconduct under the Stand-\n-.- ing Orders. The defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have\nbeen cured if the company had produced the witnesses\nbefore the Tribunal and given an opportunity to Das\nto cross-examine them there. The co1npany came up in appeal by special leave to\nthe Supreme Court, where, for the first time it raised the ques\ntion of the qualification and competency of the one member\nTribunal under s. 7 of the Act. The same principle\nwould apply in case of adjudication under s. 15 of the\nAct, and if there was defect in the enquiry by the\nemployer he could make good that <:J.efect by producing\nnecessary evidence before the tribunal. v.\nHeld, further, that if there was defect in the conduct of thC' Its Workn,.n\nenquiry by the employer it could be cured if all the relevant\nevidence including the witnesses who were not examined in the\npresence of the workman were produced before the Tribunal. It will he immediately clear that these principles\nwere not followed in the enquiry which took place\non March 12, inasmuch as the witnesses on which\nthe company relied were not examined in the presence\nof Das. C. is m on\nIts Workmen behalf of the company that the Tribunal had proceed\ned as if it was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held\nWamhoo J. by the company. The\ncase relates to the dismissal of one workman namely,\nB. N. Das (hereinafter called Das), which had been\ntaken up by the Assam Chah Karmchari Sangh, which\nis a registered trade union. 11,125, which has been deposited in this Court in\npursuance of this Court's order of April 22, 1957 and\nDas will not be entitled t.o anything more, as further\nstay of payment was pursuant to the order of this\nCourt. Consequently, it\nordered that Das would be entitled to his pay and\nallowances from February 28, to March 11, 1955 and\nfull pay and allowances from March 12, till the date of\npayment. Further his\nevidence does not show that t.he statements which had\nbeen recorded were read over to Das at the enquiry\nbefore he was asked to question the witnesses. 98.38 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\nwas held that \"the reading out of the contents of the\nz959\n-:--T E police report bv the Chairman at the hearing of the\nP hulbari v.e a state appeal was enoJ ugh comph. He gave a reply on March 11, that as\nthe case was sub judice in the criminal court, the\nquestion of dismissal did not arise at that stage and\nthe allegations against him would have to be proved\nin the court. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 39\nbefore the Tribunal was to produce the statements x959\nrecorded by the manager during what we have called Phulbari Tea Estati\ninvestigation. The Tribunal came to the conclusion\nthat the dismissal of Das was not justified on the\nground of proper procedure not having been followed\nand also for want of legal evidence. .c hoo J.\nin law as it shows as if the Tribunal was sitting in\nappeal on the enquiry held by the company, an<l this\nit was not entitled to do. Thereupon these witnesses were asked whether the evid\nence they had given before the manager was correct, and if not,\nthey were at liberty to amend it, to which they replied that the\nevidence they had given was correct. But considering that the Tribunal\nwas also of opinion that proper procedure had not\nbeen followed we have still to see whether that find\ning of the Tribunal justifies the conclusion at which ..\nit arrived. In-these circumstances\n'\none of the basic principles of natural justice in an\nenquiry of this nature was not observed, and, there\nfore, the finding of the Tribunal that proper procedure\nhad not been followed is justified and is not open to\nchallenge."

  "summary": "It is clear that this section does not\napply to the respondents because they are employees\nin a. factory and not in any of the establishments\nenumerated in its two sub-sections.144 SUPREM~ COURT REPORTS (1960(1)]\nz959 The respondents' case, however, is that by virtue of\ns. 70 of the Act the provisions of the Factories Act,\nB. P~.HiY• including s. 59, are extended to the cases of all em-\nc. M. Pradhan ployees in factories, and so they are entitled to claim\n- wages for overtime under the said section of the\nGajendragadkar J. The Authority under the Payment of Wages Act\nfound that only four of the respondents, who were required to do\nthe work of progress timekeepers, could claim the status of\nworkers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act and\nthe rest were merely employees of the workshop, but the\nAuthority accepted the alternative case made by the respond\nents and directed the appellant to file a statement showing the\novertime wages due to each of the respondents and ordered it to\npay the same. Alternatively he urged that even if he wa.s not a\nworker within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the sa.id Act,\nhe would neverthless be entitled to overtime wages\nunder the said s. 59 by reason of s. 70 of the Bombay\nShops and Establishments Act, 1948 (Bom. The final decision of the Authority is, however,\nbased on the view that under s. 70 of the Act the\nrespondents would be entitled to overtime wages\nunder s. 59 of the Factories Act even if they are not\nworkers under s. 2(1). Thus the validity of the said section is not\nin dispute; and so the only point which calls for our\ndecision is one of construction: Does s. 70 supplement\nthe provisions of the Factories Act by extending them\nto all employees in factories like the respondents\nthough they are not workers under s. 2(1) of the\nsaid Act? -\nand held that, even if the respondent was not a. Ga1enaragadkar J.\nworker under the Factories Act, s. 70 of the Act\nentitled him to claim overtime wages under s. 59\nof the Factories Act. ing of s. 2(1) of the said Act, they would nevertheless be entitled\nto overtime wages under the s. 59 by reason of s. 70 of .the\nBombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948 (Born. The case of the respondents was\nthat they were workers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the\nFactories Act, 1948 (LXIII of 1948) and as such were entitled\nto overtime wages under s. 59 of the said Act. It is true that the finding of the\nAuthority in respect of the timekeepers is against the\nrespondents; but Mr. Purshottam says that he is\nentitled to support the final order passed by the\nAuthority on the additional ground that the time\nkeepers, like the progress timekeepers, are workers\nunder s. 2(1) and as such they are entitled to claim\novertime wages under s. 59 of the Factories Act. I t is suggeste y t e\nv.\nappellant that the respondents are railway servants c.\nM. Pradhlln\nunder s. 3 (7) of the said Act, and as such they may --\nbe entitled to make a. claim for overtime wages under Gajendragadkar J.\nthe said proviso ; but the respondents have not made,\nand do not wish to make, a claim under the said\nprovision; and so the question as to the application\nof the said section need not detain us. • P. H.,a\nFactories Act he was neverthless entitled to claim v.\nthe benefit of s. 59 of the said Act by virtue of s. 70 c.\nM. Pradharl\nof the Act. This\nbenefit is, however, available only to persons who a.re\nworkers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the said Act\nSince we are dealing with the ca.se on the assumption\nthat the respondents are not workers under s. 2(1) it\nfollows that s. 59 by itself would not be applicable\nto them. If the conclusion of the Authority on the scop_e and\neffect of the provisions of s. 70 of the Act is correct,\nthen it would be unnecessary to consider whether the\ntimekeepers and the progress timekeepers are workers\nunder s. 2(1) of the Factories Act. The\nnon-obstante clause in the section shows that the employees in a\nfactory, although they might not be workers within the meaning\nof s. 2(1) of the Factories Act, are entitled to claim overtime\nwages as provided for by that Act. c. M. Prod/Jan It was urged on its behalf that the respondent was not\na worker under s. 2(1) of the ]'actories Act and that\nGojm4ro1•dk•r J. s. 70 of the Act did not justfy the claim alternatively\nmade by the respondent for overtime wages. Section\n63 of the Act deals with this topic ...S ection 63(1)\nprovides for the payment of overtime work at the\nrate of H times the ordinary rate of w~ges in the\ncase of employees in any establishment other than a\nresidential hotel, restaurant, or eating-house, whereas\nsub-s. (2) provides for wages for overtime at the rate\nof twice the ordinary rate of wages in respect of\nemployees in a residential hotel, restaurant or eating\nhouse, subject to the other conditions specified in the\nsaid section. On a proper construction of s. 70 of the Act it is clear that\nthe first part of the section excludes a factory and its employees\nfrom the operation of the Act ; but the second part makes the\nrelevant provisions of the Factories Act applicable to them. It is not disputed by the appellant\nthat the Bombay Legislature was competent to\nprescribe for the extension of the provisions of the\nFactories Act to employees in the factories within the\nterritory of the State of Bombay; and since sanction\nfor this legislation has been duly obtained from the\nGovernor-General of India on January 3, 1949('), no\nquestion about ll.ny repugnance between the provi\nsions of s. 70 and those of the Factories Act can pos\nsibly a.rise. v. Consistently with its policy, the Act, which provides for\nC. M. PradhaH overtime wages for employees in all establishments, provides for\novertime wages for employees in factories as well by making the\nrelevant provisions of the Factories Act applicable to them. 2(m) of the Factories Act defines a factory as\nmeaning any premises including the precincts thereof-\n\" (i) whereon ten or more workers are working,\nor were working on any day of the preceding\ntwelve months, and in any part of which a\nmanufacturing process is being carried on with the\naid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, or\n(ii) whereon twenty or more workers are working,\nor were working on aiiy day of the preceding twelve\nmonths, and in any part of which a manufacturing\nprocess is being carried on without the aid of power,\nor is ordinarily so carried on,-\nbut does not include a mine subject to the opera\ntion of the Mines Act, 1952 (XXXV of 1952), or a\nrailway running shed;\"\nands. Section 70 provides that nothing in this Act shall be\ndeemed to apply to any person employed in or within\nthe precincts of a factory and the provisions of the\nFactories Act shall, notwithstanding anything in the\nsaid Act, apply to such person. A worker under s. 2(1) means a\nperson employed directly or through any agency,\nwhether for wages or not, in any manufacturing pro\ncess, or in cleaning any part of the machinery or\npremises used for manufacturing process, or in any\nother kind of work incidental to, or connected with,\nthe manufacturing process, or the subject of the\nmanufacturing process; and the manufacturing pro\ncess under s. 2(k) means any process for inter alia (1)\nmaking, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing,\npacking, oiling, washing, cleaning, breaking-up,\ndemolishing or otherwise treating or adapting any\narticle or substance with a view to its use, sale,\ntransport, delivery or disposal. special leave arises from the several applications made\nagainst Mr. B. P. Hira, Works Manager, Central Rail\nway Workshop and Factory, Pa.rel, Bombay (hereafter\ncalled the appellant) by the employees at the said\nfactory (hereafter called the respondents) under the\nPayment of Wages Act, 1936 (IV of 1936) claiming\npayment of overtime wages since 1948. If that is so,\nthey must be and are establishments under s. 2(8) of\nthe Act.148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\n1959 In this connection it must be borne in mind that\ns. 2(8) empowers the State Government to include by\nB. P ~.Hira notification any office or institution within the defini\nc. M. Pradhan tion of establishment; and so the inclusion of any such\noffice or institution in col. 2 of sch. It would have been possible for the Legislature to\ninclude in the present statute a.11 the relevant provisions\nof the Factories Act and make them applicable to\nfactories as defined by s. 2(9); but apparently the\nLegislature thought that the same object can be\nachieved by enacting the second part of s. 70. The said Act\ncontalns the provision by which workers are defined\nunder s. 2(1), and it necessarily involves the conse\nquerue that the relevant provision about the payment\nof o>ertime wages applies only to workers as defined\nand not to employees in factories who are not workers. It is common ground that the place where the respon\ndents are employed is a factory under s. 2(m) of the\n}i'actories Act, and so it satisfies the defiuition of s. 2(9)\nof the Act. Section 4 applies only to establish·\nments and not to factories; but even if it applied, to factories\n18138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\nZ9$9 that cannot materially affect the application of s. 70 which is\nintended to operate not withstanding the other provisions of the\nB. P. Hira Act. The Allthority\nwas disposed to take the view that having regard to\nthe nature of the work assigned to the progress time\nkeepers they must be held to be persons employed in\nwork incidental to, or connected with the manufac\nturing process or the subject of the manufacturing\nprocess and as such they are workers within the mean\ning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act. It is not correct to say that s. 4 of the Bombay Shops and\nEstablishments Act, 1948, has the effect of excluding the opera\ntion of s. 70 of the Act. It is true that the definition of \"establish\nment\" does not expressly exclude factory ; but it is\nplain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and\ndistinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions\nin the Act which apply to establishment are not\nintended to, and do not, apply to factories. It is conceivable that a kitchen\nattached to an establishment like a residential hotel\nmay satisfy the definition of factory ; but it seems to\nus that such an adjunct of an establishment is prima\nfacie not intended by the Act to be treated apart and\nseparately from the main establishment itself; and so\nit would be taken as a part of the establishment and\nbe governed by the provisions of the Act in relation\nthereto. These appeals by special leave arose from applications made\nby the respondents, who were employed as timekeepers in the\ntime office of the Central Railway Workshop and Factory, Parel,\nBombay, claiming payment of overtime wages under the Payment\nof Wages Act, 1936 (4 of 1936). The non-obstante clause in\ns. 7( thus serves the purpose of clarifying the position\nthatthe Factories Act is made applicable to employees\nin factories and that they are not governed by any of\nthe Jrovisions of the Act. It has itself\nmacb provision for the payment of overtime wages to\nempoyees in all establishments by s. 63 ; and it has\nmade applicable inter alia the relevant provisions of\nthe 1actories Act in regard to employees in factories. The respondent alleged tha.t he\nwa.s a. worker within the meaning of s. 2, sub-s. (1) of\nthe said Factories Act (LXIII of 1948) and &f! SUPREME COURT REPORTS 149\nis intended to clarify the position that though factory I959\nhas been defined by s. 2(9) of the Act, no provision of\nB.P.Hira\nthe A ct is intend e d to be applied to a. factory or v.\nemployees in it. The first point which has been urged before us by\nthe learned Attorney-General on behalf of the appel\nlant is that the Authority was in error in holding that\nthe progress timekeepers are workers under s. 2(1) of\nthe Factories Act. Indeed as we\nhave already observed, no provision of the Act except\ns. 70 applies to factories and so it would not be legiti-\nmate to base any argument on the assumption that\ns. 4 is applioable to the present case. It is in reference to this provision that s. 70 has provi\nded t.liat notwithstanding the said provision the relevant\nprovsions of the Factories Act will apply to persons\nemployed in a factory."

The contention was that without\na notice under s. 24(2) within the assessment year or a\nnotice under s. 38(1) (corresponding to s. 34 (1) of the\nAct) the 'best judgment' assessment was bad. The appellant contended that\nthe voluntary return \\\\'as no return as it clid not disclose any\ntaxable income and tlic assesstnent \\\\'as valic.1 under the proviso\nto s. 3-1-(J) of the 1\\ct, ha\\'ing been rnacle \\Vithin one year of the\nnotice issued under s. 34(1). But it could not\nissue a notice under s. 34 after a return was already\nmade before it, and the benefit of the extended period\nof limitation for assessment available under the first\nproviso to sub-s. (3) of s. 34 of one year from the\nservice of the notice under snh-s. (I) of that section was\nnot available in this case. To say that, was not to\nsay that even a return filed in compliance with a\nnotice under section 22(2), if filed belatedly under\nsection 22(3) could not be a return showing an\nincome below the taxable limit.'' He alRo contended that he was\nentitled under s. 22(3) to make voluntary\" return\n[t \"\non the date he did, and with a voluntary return before\nthe Income-tax Officer, there was no scope for the\nissuance of a notice under s. 34. But if the return made by the assessee was no\nreturn at all, then the conditions under the first sub\n'' section of s. 34 obtained, and the assessment could he\ncompleted within one year of the date of service of the\nnotice (l\\Iarch 3, 1950), i.e. ;essee, and gave its\nopinion that the Department ought to have issued a\nnotice under s. 22(2) within the assessment year, and\nif no return was made within the time fixed by the\nnotice; the Department 8hould have proceeded under\ns. 23(4) to a 'best judgment' assessment. Three\nyears later, a notice under s. 24(2) of that Act\n(corresponding to s. 22(2) of the Act) was served, and\na return showing an income below the taxable\nminimum was filed.

The Bombay High Court also enter\ntains the view that the asse-ssment proceedings com\nmence with the issue of '' public: notice, and that s. 34\nof the Act cannot apply, whero in answer to the publie\nnotice a return is made whether of taxable income or\nnot. The Income-tax Officer,\n\\vho had discovered these credits \\Vhi1e exan1ining the accounts of\nthe J\\ssar Syndicate, ignored the voluntary return, and, on\nF'cbruary 27, 1950, issued a notice under s. 34(1) of the Act\ncalling upon the assessec to submit his return. The Income-tax Officer did not act on this return,\nbut on February 27, 1950 he issued a notice purporting\nto be under s. 34 of the Act calling upon the assessee\nto submit his return.

Sultan Ali Gharami (3) R. K. Ranchhoddas\n• . ' That section,\nthey opined, contemplated the filing of a return of\ntaxable income, and a return not showing such income\nwas not a return at all in law. The view of the Calcutta High Court is that\nassessment proceedings commence either with a notice\nunder s. 22(2) of the Art or with the filing of a return\nshowing taxable income. The con\ntroversy centres round the fact that the return, when\nit was filed, disclosed an income which was below the\nmaximum not chargeable to tax, and the question is\nwhether in such an event the Income-tax Officer was\nprecluded from issuing a notice under s. 34 of the Act. A public notice under s. 22(1) of the· Income-tax Act, 1922\nwas published on May r, 1945, requiring every person whose total\nincome exce'eded the niaximum amount \\vhich \\\\'as not charge\nable to inco1ne-tax to file returns for the assr!ismcnt year 1945-46.

  "summary": "In dealing with puja bonus based on an\n'implied term of employment, it was pointed out by us\nin Messrs. lspahani Ltd. v. lspahani Employees'\nUnion (1 that a term may be implied, even though the\n)\npayment may not have been at a uniform rate\nthroughout and the Industrial Tribunal would be\njustified in deciding what should be the quantum of\npayment in a particular year taking into account the\nvarying payments made in pr1;1vious years. Held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as\nan implied term of employment for an implied agreement could\nnot be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the\npayments from 1948 to 1952 were ex gratia ; but they were\nentitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was a customary and\ntraditional payment. In determining whether the payment was\ncustomary and traditional the following circumstances have to be\nestablished :\n(i) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series\nof years; ,\n(ii) that it has been for a sufficiently long period, the\nperiod has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of\nemployment;\n(iii) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not\ndepend on the earning of profits ; and\n(iv) that the payment has been made at a uniform rate\nthroughout. The\ndecision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the\ntwo aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based\non an implied term of employment or on custom; but\nit came to the conclusion that there was sufficient\nevidence to establish custom and therefore ordered\npayment of one month's basic wages as puja bonus. The dispute arose regarding\nthe payment of bonus in 1953· The workmen claimed that the\nsole object of bonus which had been grantecf to them upto that year\nwas to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus\nhad become customary and a term of employment. bonus than may be the case with puja bonus based on\nan implied term of employment; (iii) the circumstance\nthat the payment depended upon the earning of profits\nwould have to be excluded and therefore it must be\nshown that payment was made in years of loss. It is,\nhowever, clear that puja bonus which is usually paid\nin Bengal is of two kinds; namely, (1) where it is paid\nas an implied term of employment as explained in\nM ahalaxmi Cottan Mills case(') and (2) where it is paid\nas a customary and traditional payment as stated in\nthe Industrial Tribunal's award referred to above. At that time it was said\non behalf of the company before the industrial\ntribunal that some bonus was being paid and that\nthere was no intention to discontinue it and conse\nquently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the\nmatter, which shows that the company recognised the\ntraditional and customary nature of the payment and\nit assured the tribunal that there was no intention\nthen to discontinue the payment. In the face' of such notice year by year it\n(India) Ltd.\nwould not be possible to imply a term of employment v.\non the basis of an implied agreement, for agreement Its Workmen\npostulates a meeting of minds regarding the subject\nWanchoo j.\nmatter of an agreement; and here one party was\nalways making it clear that the payment was ex gratia\nand that it would not form a precedent for future\nyears. It was pointed out that in Trading Co.\n(India) Ltd.\nfour years during this period the payment was made\nv.\nin November and December and not about the time of\nIts Workmen\nthe pujas; and, therefore, it could not be said that\nthis was traditional and customary puja bonus. The workmen then contended in their letter of Septem\nber 21, 1953 that the sole object of bonus which had, been\ngranted upto that year was to meet puja expenses and\nthat the payment of this bonus had become customary\nand a term of employment. 24.S.C.R SUPREME COUR'f REPORTS 111\n1948 to 1952, the company whenever it paid this z959\nbonus, made it clear that it was an ex gratia payment\nThe Gra/lam\nand would not constitute any precedent for future\nTrading Co.\nyears. In such a case, the Tribunal will have to\nconsider: (i) whether the payment has been over an\nunbroken series of years; (ii) whether it has been for a\nsufficiently long period, though the length of the period\nmight depend on the circumstances of each case : even\nso the period may normally have to be longer to\njustify an inference of traditional and customary puja. It\nwas also inclined to the view that the company's\naccounts showing loss were not reliable and there might\neven be a case for profit bonus; but eventually it\ngranted one month's basic wages as customary puja\nbonus. The\nchairman of the board of directors of the company\nvisited Calcutta in 1952 and then on the represehtation\nof the workmen the advance was converted into one\nmonth's bonus and even those workmen who had not\naccepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus. All the\nconditions, therefore, of a customarv and traditional\nbonus are satisfied in this case and there is no reason\nto interfere with the order of the Appellate Tribunal,\nthough we should like to make it clear that we do not\nagree with the observations of the Appellate Tribunal\nin connection with the profit bonus aspect of the\nmatter. It cannot therefore be said that there was any break\nin the payment of bonus from 1940 to 1952, for if the\nchairman had not converted what was advance of pay\ninto bonus in December 1952, the workmen might\nha. Later the matter was\nconsidered in Mahalaxmi Cottan Mills case('), where\ncertain tests were laid down which would justify the\ninference that there was an implied term of employ\nment for payment of bonus at the time of the annual\nDurga Puja. In 1951, one month's bonus was paid\nin October and half a month's further bonus was paid\nin December. From 1948 to 1952, the appellant whenever it paid this bonus,\nmade it clear that it was ex gratia payment and would not consti\ntute any precedent in future years. sidered the remaining two aspects, namely, whether\npuja bonus could be awarded either as an implied\nterm of employment according to the decision in\nM ahalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd., Calcutta v. M ahalakshmi\nCotton Mills Workers' Union (g) or on the basis of\ncustom."

The learned\nCounsel relying upon the words \"prevailing conditions\"\nand the subsequent words \"in all the circumstances of\na given case\" contai1rnd in the above observation of\nPatanjali Sastri, C.

It appears that t.l1e export agency felt that the\npetitioners were neither going to sell the sugar and pay\nthe sale proceeds nor to deliver the sugar and it there-\nupon pointed out to the petitioners that they were hy\ntheir conduct exposing themRelves to the risk of\nhaving to pay the additional excise duty under s. 7. In reply, the learned Attorney-General on behalf\nof the Union as well as the Directorate of Sugar refers\nto the negotiations which took place between the\nGovernment and the sugar industry and the arrange\nments which were made to save owners of factories\nfrom the loss which is inevitable as a result of this\nexport programme. But I am clear in my\nmind that·the validity of an Act shall not be made to\ndepend upon another Act unconnected with the\nimpugned Act or power conferred thereunder, which\n.might, if properly exercised, off.set the evil tendency\nor the vice of the impugned Act. -overnment to d el egate, su b\"1 ect to c011 d\"1 t1· 0ns The Lord Krishna\nSugar ill ills Ltd. •\nif any, its functions under the Act to an officer or and Another\nauthority specified by notification.

It was argued by\nMr. Pritt, Q.C., before the Privy Council that the later\nHidayati<llah 1\nAct could not be read to justify the earlier Act, because\nif the impugned Citizenship Act were bad when it was\npassed, it could not be 'brought back to light' by the\nenactment of the subsequent Act. It\nis also pointed out that Government at that time did\nnot wish to take over the work of export on itself\nand specified as the export agency, the Indian Sugar\nMills Association, a body composed of 95 per cent.

The Lord Krishna\nIt cannot but be accepted that the Government sugar Mills Ltd.,\nmade adequate arrangements to recoup the sugar and Another\nindustry for the loss which it might suffer in giving\n.y. It appears however that various\nrepresentatives of the Government and the sugar\nmanufacturers met and decided upon the idea of export\ning sugar for earning foreign exchange in Government's\ninkrest and getting a foothold in the world market in\nthe int~rests of the manufacfurers. It is said that the notification issued by\nthe Central Government under s. 3 of that Act and r. 5\nof the Order made thereunder was to off-;;et the loss\nexpected to be incurred under the Ordinance, and\ntherefore, the Act whi('h supplanted the Ordinance,\nmust be deemed to have been pn,ssed on the basis of\nthat notification. We heard consi\nderable argument as to whether the section would\napply to a case where no delivery was at all made, in\nview of the words :\n\"where sugar delivered by any owner falls short\nof the export quota.\" Besides, there was nothing in the Essential Commodities\nAct or the Sugar (Control) Order which authorised the Govern\nment to increase the price for the sake of recouping to the\nmanufacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned Act, and\nI . It provides n.s follows:\n(l) \"The export agency shn.11, at such time as it\nthinks fit, make to the owners who ha.ve delivered\nsugar to it urnler this Act, payments dc,tc.rmined in\naccordance with the provisions hereinafter in this\nsection contained.

They contend that\nif foreign exchange is so urgently needed, there should\nhave been uniform legislation compelling other sugar\nmanufacturers, who do not manufacture by the vacuum\npan process, also to export sugar.

In the Objects\n& Reasons of the Act it is stated,\n\"With a view to earning foreign exchange it is\nnecessary to promote export of sugar. The sugar\nmanufacturers did not approve of the Act, being con\ntent to depend on the Government's sense of fair play\nto relieve the hardship caused by it.78 SUPltEME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]\n'959 There remains one other contention to deal with. It is necessary now to set out the terms of s. 9 of\nthe Act which fixes the amount which a manufacturer\nof sugar in entitled to receive in respect of the sugar\ndelivered by him. 6(53)/58-SC, dated ,June 27, 1958, the\nChief Director, Directorate of Sugar and Va naspati,\nfixed 461 ·05 and 412·04 tons of sugar as the quantities\napportioned to the L. K. S. Mills and the S. P. B. J\\fills\nrespectively. The substance of the matter then is that an owner\nof a sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli\nvered by him under the Act, a proportionate share of\nthe sale-proceeds less the Pxpenses. In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 3\nof the said Act, the Central Government issued an\norder dated August 27, 1955, called the Sugar(Control)\nOrder, 1955. But for the Act, the\npetitioners could have Kold their sugar in the open\nmarket without exceeding the rnkK fix.,d under the\nEssential Commodities Act, l!.J!i5. Apart from\nv. saying that the Act would stabilise the sugar industry,\nThe Union of India the affidavits used on behalf of the respondents do not\nand .1no1hu show how that would be done or that there was any\nneed for it. They raise the question whether the Sugar\nExport Promotion Act, 1958 is invalid as imposing\nan unreasonable restriction on the petitioners' right to\ncarry on their trade. The\nnotification of the Central Government increasing the price of\nsugar to enable the recoupment of the loss occasioned by the\nexport could be taken into consideration in judging the\nreasonableness of the restrictions. So what the trade had agreed to was that they\nwould be prepared to export sugar provided they were\nleft free to recoup from the internal sales the loss\ncaused by the export. It provides:\n\"(1) Where sugar delivered ·by any owner falls\nshort of the export quota fixed for it by any quantity\n(hereinafter referred to. I\nThe restrictions imposed by the impugned Act were not\nunreasonable as the j_ct served the national interest by earning\nforeign exchange for the State and building up foreign markets\nfor the future prosperity of the sugar industry. It is said that the\nAct was passed with a view to earn foreign exchange\nby export of sugar. The restriction\nwas not unreasonable, because arrangement was made\nto save the owners of the factories from loss, and the\nloss entailed by the export of sugar was to be borne\nby the consumers in India and not by the producers. It is said that the prm·ailing conditions anrl the cir\ncumstances of the case would inclrnfo 1-hc orrler increas\ning the home price of sugar made under the Essential\nCommorlit.ies Act. Though in deciding the\nreasonablene1>s of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act\nall the prevailing conditions and circumstances had to be\nconsidered, the notification increasing the home price of sugar\ncould not be taken into consideration. In the years 1952-53 to 1955-56 India imported large\nquantities of sugar and did not export sugar at all. It is said that this is so ; that in judging the reason\nableness of the restriction imposed by one Act, it is\npermissible to consider an order made by the executive\nGovernment under another Act. Section 5\nrequires the Central Government to apportion the\nquantity fixed under s. 4 among the owners of factories\nproducing sugar by the vacuum pan process in pro\nportion to the quantity produced or likely to be\nproduced by them respectively, during the season.

The learned Attorney-General also\ncontends that the petitioners had obtained favourable\nprices for sale of sugar in the country but were not\nwilling to honour their other commitments which,\nafter the agreement of the sugar industry, were given\nlegislative form. That the\nCentral Government has selected the sugar industry\nfor an export programme does not mean that it cannot\nmake a classification of the commodities, bearing in\nmind which commodity will have an easy market\nabroad for the purpose of earning foreign exchange. .S uch price or maximum price\nshall be fixe<l with due regard to the price or minimum Sarkar J.\nprice fixed for sugar cane, manufacturing cost, taxes,\nreasonable margin of profit for producer and/or trade,\nand any incidental charges. 91 and 92 of the British\nNorth America Act, 1867, The Legislative Assembly\nof the Province of Alberta passed an Act respecting\nthe taxation of banks' and imposed thereunder on\nevery corporation or joint stock company other than\nthe Bank of Canada, incorporated for the purpose of\ndoing banking or savings bank business in the\nProvince, an annual tax, in addition to any tax\npayable under any other Act. The apportionment of the\nquantity of sugar to be exported is to be in proportion\nto the quantity of sugar produced or likely to be\nproduced by the owners during the season referred to\nearlier. Section 8 deals with export of sugar or its sale by\nthe owner or the export agency.

Out of\nthe 50,000 tons, about half was sold in India, and with\nthe sale-proceeds other sugar was bought and exported,\nand this would not be possible if the export agency\nwere required to make a spot cash payment. Section 8 then deals with the export by the export\nagency of sugar delivered to it. The\nargument over16oks the scheme that export is made\nby a Central Agency for the industry as a whole, and\nthe prices obtained abroad are payable, and they are\nless than those at which sugar of various grades sells\nwithin the country. From the provisions of the Act earlier set out, it is\nquite clear that it requires the owner of .a sugar factory\nto part with a portion of the produce of his factory in\nexchange for an amount to he fixed under the provi\nsions of s. 9. as the said quantity), there\nshall be levied and collected on so much of the sugar\ndespatched from the factory for consumption in India\nas is equal to the said quantity, a duty of excise at\nthe rate of seventeen rupees per maund...\nS.C.R.

To capture foreign\nmarket or to have a substantive share therein is not\nan easy task, as it depends upon many imponderables,\nnamely, the availability of sugar, its demand, its\ncomparative ID;erit,s with the sugar produced in other\nmarkets, transport facilities, mutual agreement requift\nments, international affiliations etc. The The U11i011 01 India\nl earnc d Cl u· e f J usti· c e, t } i ere f\"o re, m· l 1 1• s grap Ju ·c • t l escri· p - a ud ·~ not/1·• r\ntion of the test of reasonablenefi!s, in my view, was suhl>a Rao 1.\nnot stating any thing more than the obvious, for the\nstandard of reasonableness is inextricably conditioned\nby the state of society and the urgency for eradicating\nthe evil sought. -\nAs appears from its preamble, the Act was intended\nto provide for the export of sugar in public interest\nand it set up a machinery for that purpose.

The illustrations are not exhaustive, but they all fall\nunder one or other of the following two categories :\n(i) an earlier Act is made part of a new Act; and (ii) both\nActs are parts of a legislative scheme or plan where\nboth of them were conceived at the inception but\npassed in stages, or conceived at different times on the\nbasis of experience gained but passed in furtherance\nof the same scheme. The\nEssential Commodities Act, 1955 (Act 10 of 1955), was\nenacted for the purpose mentioned in the preamble to\nthat Act. The impugned Act was passed on\nSeptember 16, 1958 repealing the Ordinance and re\nenacting its provisions and also providing that anything\ndone under the Ordinance would be deemed to have\nbeen done under the Act as if it had come into force\nwhen the Ordinance had been promulgated. That reason involves a principle of far-reaching\nimportance, namely, whether, in ascertaining the\nreasonableness of restrictions imposed by a statute on\na fundamental right, it is permissible to rely upon a\nnotification issued by Government in exercise of power\nconferred on it by another Act unconnected with the\nimpugned one. They\nfurther state that if the necessity for foreign exchange\nwas felt, the loss entailed in the earning of foreign\nexchange should be borne by Government or be distri\nbuted among all industries, or at least among all the\nsugar producers in the country. The\nexport agency also sent an order for delivery of the\nquota sugar, and required the L.K.S.

It would thus\nappear that the sugar industry in India has always\nbeen stable and did not require any export to make it\nstable. Since the export was by a non-profit-making\nagency composed of the sugar industry, it is obvious\nthat the payments could not be made forthwith. I proceed now to consider t.he respondents'\nrea.son for saying that the Act imposes 110 loss on the\nsugar manufacturers including the petitioners. In that case, the question was whether\nthe Ceylon Citizenship Act (18 of 1948) and the\nCeylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act\n(48 of 1949) were valid, or were ultra vires the\nCeylon Parliament, being void under s. 29(2) of the\nCeylon (Constitution and Independence) Order-in\nCouncil, 1946 (as amended).

(c) To reduce the accumulation of stocks in the\nfactories and to make room for further storage, and to\nliquidate the stocks into cash, serious efforts be made\neither from Government to Government or through\ntrade channels to export out at least 2 lakh tons: Alter\nnatively, the State Governments be asked to take\ndelivery of the quantities from the factories and store\nthem in their own godowns. The petitioners\nand Another contend that the whole export programme in respect\nof sugar amounts to an infringement of their fund\nHidayatullah ].

The impugned Act which made the petitioners\nsuffer a loss on the sale of a part of their produce imposed\nunreasonable restrictions on their fundamental right to carry on\ntheir business and was invalid.

The Appellate Tribunal reiterated this in Shalimar\nRO'pe Works Mazdoor Union, How1·ah v. Messrs.

The Rashtriya Mill\n- Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay, (r950) L.L.J. It is this last condition\nwhich seems to have been relied upon by industrial •\ntribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec\ntion hetween the efforts of labour and the profits, and\nunless that direct connection is established the profits\nmust be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour\nand thus become extraneous income. Such\nincome or profit may be called extraneous income as\neither it did not really arise in that year or though it\nhas arisen in that year, labour has not contributed\nanything towards its accrual ; it may therefore not be\ntaken into account in calculations according to the\nFull Bench formula. In carrying on that business it employs Th T Oil M'll\ncapita.I as well as labour, and generally speaking the 8 ~;~ Ltd. • s\nprofits earned in the normal course of business at t4e\nv.\nend of year are the result of the joint effort of capital Its Workmen and\nand labour. But apart from these cases, we\ncannot see how income arising during the year in the\nnormal course of business of the concern can be called\nextraneous income merely on the ground that no direct\nconnection between the efforts of labour and the\naccrual of the income has been established. In short, income\nby way of rent, light and power arises in the normal\ncourse of business of the concern and there is no reason\nwhy a direct contribution by labour during the year\nin question must be insisted upon in the case of such\nincome. An affidavit was made on behalf of\nthe company that it had used its reserve funds com\nprising premium on ordinary shares, general reserve,\ndepreciation reserve, workmen's compensation reserve,\nemployees' gratuity reserve, bad and doubtful debt\nreserves and sales promotion reserve as working\ncapital. This being\nthe basis on which a return on reserves used as work\ning capital is allowed, there is no reason why, if there\nis in fact money available in the depreciation reserve\nand if that money is actually used during the year as\nworking capital, a return should not be allowed on\nsuch money also. It will, however,\nbe open to the workmen in future to show by proper\ncross-examination of the company's witnesses or by\nproper evidence that the amount shown as the depre-\nciation reserve was not available in whole or in part\nto be used as working capital and that whatever may\nbe available was not in fact so used in the sense\nexplained above. Though there must be contribution of the workmen in\nearning profits before they could be entitled to profit bonus, it\nwas not necessary to establish direct connection between the\nefforts of the workmen and each item of profit earned. in lacs\nLess dividend on paid-up 5•54\nThe Tata Oil Mills\ncapital\nCo., Ltd.\nLess return on Reserves used 5•56\nv.\nIts Worknien and as working capital of Rs.

But so\nfar as the other four items are concerned, they are\nearned by the company in the normal course of its\nbusiness and there is no reason why they should be\nexcluded on the ground that it has not been proved\nthat they are the result of direct efforts of labour in\nthis year. The reason given by the Tribunal for disallowing these\nitems was that they formed part of the profits earned\nin the course of the company's business .and there was\nno goocl reason for deducting them from the profits. pose of the ]'ull Bench formula due (i) either to some\npart of the profits not having bee°t earned in that year,\n,\n• (ii) or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous\ncircumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts\nof labour. In\nThe Mill-Owners' Association, Bombay v. The Rashtriya\nMill .Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay (1) in which the ]'ull\n,j\nBench formula was evolved, the appellate tribunal\nrernal'ked at page 1257:\n\" No scheme of allocation of bonus could be\ncomplete if the amount out of which a bonus is to be\npaid is unrelated to employees' efforts.\" In these circumstances we fail to see why co.,\nLtd.\nthis income by sale of surplus coconuts should be\nv.\nexcluded from the profits for the purpose of the Full Its Workmen anrl\nBench formula. Held, that the four items were earned by the appellant in\nthe normal cour1>e of its business and could not be excluded from\nthe gross profits on the ground that it had not been proved that\nthev were the result of the direct efforts of labour in the bonus\ny~a·r. The liquidators were refused sanction to appeal from the\nsaid award by the High Court whereupon the auction-purchaser\nwho was also the managing director of the Company, prior to\nits liquidation, preferred an appeal in the name of the Company\nrepresented by himself as the managing director and also in his\ncapacity as the auction-purchaser of the Company. previous year 0·31\n{v) Refund of income-tax on revision of\nCochin assessment of Excess Profits Tax 0·49\n(vi) Sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, logs,\nplanks, gunnies &c. 2·u\nTotal 4·12\nThe Tribunal rejected the claim with respect to all\nthese items, though in the judgment it mentioned only\nitems (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi) as those in dispute. Income\nreceived by way of rent of quarters and by sale of\nscrap-materials has generally been treated as extra\nneous income by the industrial tribunals on the basis\nof these decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal. We\nare, therefore, of opinion that income from rent, light\n•\nand power arises in the normal course of business of a\nconcern and cannot be treated as extraneous income in\nthe sense described above. The Industrial Tribunal disallowed the claim of the\ncompany on all these three points and after making\nrelevant calculations came to the conclusion that there\nwas a sufficient surplus available to permit the grant\nof bonus for 3l months calculated on basic wages and\n1\ntherefore awarded the same. It is only when profits are made that\nprofit bonus can be 11w1trded, subject to two further\nconditions, n:i,mely, (1) W>tges fall short of the living\nstandard and (2) the industry makes large profits part\nof which are duo to the contribution which the work\nmen make in produrtion. In the circumstances no case has been made\nout for increasing the profit bonus beyond what the\ncompany has already paid, particularly when we find i\nthat the company has claimed no rehabilitation\ncharges in this year. It would, co., Ltd.\ntherefore, be impossible for us now to over-look that v.\naffidavit, particularly when the Tribunal gave no Its Workmen and\nreason why it treated the working capital as Rs. SUPREME COUR'f REPORTS 5\nother three items specifically and was content to\nz959\ninclude them on the general ground that they were The T ~a M\"ll\nprofits earned in the course of the company's business. It was fort.lier observed at page 999- ,\n\"lt is therefore cle.ar that the claim for bonus\ncan be made by the employees only if as n result of\nthe joint contribution of capital and labour the indus\nt.rinl concern has earned profits. The principles laid\ndown in that case show that there must be profits in\nthe particular year for which bonus is claimed, result\ning in nn available smplus before profit bonus can be\nawarded. Whatever is the income from the sale of these barrels\nis in reality a reduction in the cost price of chemicals\nto the company, though by the method of accounting\nemployed it may appear as profit on the sale of\nbarrels. It is well known that many industrial concerns 1\n'1 he Tata Oil Mills provide amenities for their workmen by building\nco., quarters, which are provided with light and power\nLtd.\nfrom the concern's power house. These items may be taken together, for\nthe nature of the receipt is the same, though on account\nof the method of accounting employed, the income in\nthe case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case\nof scrnps etc., it is shown as sale proceeds. We do not\nsee why this income arising in the normal course of the\ncompany's business should not be taken into account\non the plea that labour has not directly contributed in\nits accrual. How can the company claim to exclude the rent etc.,\nfrom the profits while meeting the expenditure relating\nto such assets out of the profits, part of which is\natt.ributable to the efforts of labour? 3 lacs appearing in the accounts due to the\nchange in the method of valuation was no real profit\ndue to the efforts of labour and should not be taken\ninto account in arriving at the available surplus. in lacs\nGross Profits 49•55\nLess total statutory\n•\ndepreciation 13·19\nBalance...... 36·36\nIncome-tax at -/7/- in 15·90\na rupee\nThe available surplus· of profit thus works out at\nRs."
